The mutiny began early on Friday when rogue soldiers demanding bonus pay seized Bouake. Soldiers at military camps in cities and towns across Ivory Coast, including the commercial capital Abidjan, joined the rebellion.  A deal was reached between the government and the soldiers late on Saturday. A mutineer close to the negotiations said soldiers had returned to barracks. \"We have cleared the corridors everywhere as promised and we have been in barracks since last night,\" Sergeant Mamadou Kone told Reuters. \"All over the country all our men have returned to barracks and wait for their money. The mutiny is over for us.\"  He said the soldiers expect to be paid on Monday under the deal brokered by Defense Minister Alain-Richard Donwahi, raising pressure on a government that faces further unrest if demands are not met. In a sign of tensions, renegade troops on Saturday opened fire outside the house in Bouake where the negotiations took place, temporarily trapping Donwahi, witnesses said. The terms of the final deal were not made public, but sources said that the soldiers demanded 5 million CFA francs ($8,000) each, which for more than 8,000 soldiers could cost tens of billions of CFA francs.  \n Ivory Coast - which has French-speaking West Africa's largest economy - has emerged from a 2002-2011 political crisis as one of the continent's rising economic stars. But years of conflict and a failure to reform its army, made up of former rebel fighters and government soldiers, have left it hobbled by division. The revolt comes two years after a near identical uprising which ended when the government offered mutineers amnesty from punishment and a financial settlement. A repeat of the solution raises the risk soldiers will be encouraged to do it again. \n Traffic in Bouake, snarled since Friday by roadblocks and barricades, was clear on Sunday, residents said. The gunfire of recent days had stopped.  Other cities were also calm, residents said, including Abidjan, where a day earlier loyalist troops were deployed at strategic locations and residents rushed to buy bottled water and other provisions.  There was no military on the streets on Sunday. People were seen walking to church, shops were open and traffic moved as normal, a Reuters reporter said.   \n ($1 = 622.7500 CFA francs)  (Additional reporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly and Joe Bavier in Abidjan; Writing by Edward McAllister; Editing by Mark Potter and Angus MacSwan)",

Police in Alaska took a handgun from the man accused of killing five people at Fort Lauderdale's airport on Friday, but they returned it to him last month after a medical evaluation found he was not mentally ill, authorities said on Saturday. Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq war veteran, had a history of acting erratically and investigators are probing whether mental illness played a role in the latest U.S. mass shooting. According to court papers, he told agents he planned the attack and bought a one-way ticket to Florida. Santiago was charged on Saturday in federal court and could potentially face the death penalty if convicted in the case, U.S. prosecutors said.  Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in Anchorage, told a news conference Santiago walked into the office in November and said his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. He was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental evaluation. \"Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS (the Islamic State militant group,)\" Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley told the news conference.  A handgun police took from Santiago during the evaluation was returned to him early last month, Tolley told reporters. The police chief said it was not clear if it was the same weapon used on Friday. Officials in Anchorage said the gun was returned because Santiago had not been adjudicated to be mentally ill. \"As far as I know, this is not somebody that would have been prohibited (from having a gun) based on the information they had,\" U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler told the news conference. Investigators said they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive and that the suspect's recent travel is being reviewed.  Federal prosecutors charged Santiago with carrying out violence at an airport, causing serious bodily injury, using a firearm during a crime of violence and causing death to a person through the use of a firearm, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.  \n He will appear in court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday. Five people were killed and six wounded in the rampage, while about three dozen were taken to local hospitals with bruises or broken bones suffered in the chaos as passengers fled the crowded baggage claim area. 'METHODICAL' SHOOTING \n Authorities say Santiago arrived in Ft. Lauderdale on a connecting flight from Alaska and retrieved a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom and shooting indiscriminately. \n According to the criminal complaint, Santiago fired the weapon 10 to 15 times, aiming it at his victims' heads.  \"He was described as walking while shooting in a methodical manner,\" the complaint said.   Witnesses said the gunman, who was wearing a blue \"Star Wars\" T-shirt, said nothing as he fired and surrendered to police only after running out of ammunition. The Broward County sheriff has said it took the first deputy about 70 to 80 seconds to contact the suspect after the first shots rang out and that when the deputy confronted him, he dropped the gun and was taken into custody. Authorities said three of the six victims who suffered gunshot wounds are in intensive care. The others are in good condition. Those killed included a volunteer firefighter in his sixties and a retiree on holiday with her husband. \n Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon.     A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said Santiago returned from his deployment \"a different person,\" MSNBC reported.  Santiago's brother Bryan, who lives in Puerto Rico, told CNN he believed authorities did not do enough to help his mentally ill sibling. \"They had him hospitalized for four days, and then they let him go. How are you going to let someone leave a psychological center after four days when he is saying that he is hearing voices?\" Bryan Santiago told CNN.  The attack was the latest in a series of U.S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed.    Last June, Florida was the scene of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at the gay nightclub \"Pulse\" in Orlando.

However, critics of Dlamini-Zuma, a medical doctor trained in South Africa and Britain, say she should have done more to intervene when former president Thabo Mbeki denied that HIV causes AIDs and imposed anti-scientific policies. \n Mbeki's stance has been blamed by health activists for more than 300,000 preventable deaths. Dlamini-Zuma was foreign minister in Mbeki's cabinet and one of his closest allies. Vice President Cyril Ramaphosa, a unionist-turned-business tycoon, is viewed as her most likely rival after powerful trade unions endorsed him last year.  Neither Dlamini-Zuma, 67, or Ramaphosa, 64, have declared their intention to run. \n Ramaphosa, who was once touted as a successor to Nelson Mandela, would be the first choice for many investors because his background in commerce suggests he will support more pro-business policies than many in the traditionally left-wing ANC. However, he will face criticism from opponents for his role at platinum producer Lonmin where he was a director and shareholder when violence led to police shooting dead 34 striking miners in 2012. An investigation has cleared him of wrongdoing. The Women's League has a block of votes at the party conference and are a critical lobbying group for the ANC, particularly in galvanising support among female voters. \n \"After careful consideration and opening our eyes as wide as possible, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is the only suitable candidate,\" the Women's League said in a statement. \"Her legacy and influence is known and well documented throughout the history pages of the republic and beyond.\" Many South Africans believe it is time the ANC had a female leader, a rarity on a continent with strong patriarchal heritage. Zuma has previously said that South Africa is ready for a female president.  (Editing by Alison Williams and Susan Thomas)",

There was no immediate comment from the royal court. \n Prince Mohammed has couched his \"Vision 2030\" reform plan to wean the kingdom's economy off oil in terms referencing Islamic tradition and has kept the focus on the economy, with scant concrete pledges of social change in the highly conservative kingdom. But in a country that adheres to an austere brand of Wahhabi Sunni Islam, where gender segregation is mandatory and concerts and cinemas are banned, the plan's seemingly anodyne goals to empower women, promote sports and invest in entertainment are controversial. \n Saudi Arabia's clerics offer legitimacy and public support to a king who styles himself the guardian of Islam's holiest sites. They retain control of the justice system but leave most other matters of governance to him, so long as his edicts do not contradict their interpretation of Islamic law. The government started trying to rein in what it saw as extremist viewpoints in the clergy after Islamist militant attacks inside the kingdom began in 2003, pushing hardline clerics to renounce al Qaeda and violent tactics and sacking clerics seen as disseminating radical views. \n In the later years of the reign of King Abdullah, King Salman\u2019s predecessor, some senior clerics who opposed his cautious social reforms too openly lost their jobs.

Russia's objectives were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate former Secretary of State Clinton, make it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, an unclassified report released on Friday by the top U.S. intelligence agency said. \"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\" the report said. \"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.\" Russian authorities, which have previously denied interfering in the U.S. elections, offered no immediate comment on the report on Saturday, and the reaction of the country's media was low-key.  The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U.S. government's starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U.S. Congress on Friday certified Trump\u2019s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The report's conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U.S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two-hour briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed \"the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election\" nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. In Moscow, state TV Channel One briefly covered the report, focusing on Trump's comments that the interference had no impact on the outcome of the election. The broadcaster, which led its news program on Orthodox Christmas celebrations and unusually low temperatures in the Russian capital, also said the arguments used in the U.S. report had been widely mocked by Internet users. \n RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY   \n The report said U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian military intelligence, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 \"persona\" to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and top Democrats as part of the effort. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNC's chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from \"a state party.\" However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U.S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Also on Friday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  designated U.S. election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. \n While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. \"When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,\" it said. \"We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,\" it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. The report suggested Putin was motivated in part by personal animus toward Clinton. \"Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,\" it said. \n 'TROUBLING CHAPTER IN ONGOING STORY' \n In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies' belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: \"Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations\" including the DNC. \"There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\" Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence \"relayed\" the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trump's comments. \"The President-Elect\u2019s statement that the Russian hacking had 'absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election' is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,\" Schiff said. \"It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying - which is true - it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to ... Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,\" he said. \"The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.\" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile \"facts surrounding Russia's active measures,\" adding: \"This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.\"  (Reporting by Steve Holland, Mark Hosenball, Yara Bayoumy and Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay in Washington; additional reporting by Amy Tennery in New York and Patricia Zengerle, Dustin Volz, David Alexander and Susan Heavey in Washington, Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow; Writing by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and John Stonestreet)",

An Azaz resident who went to the local hospital told Reuters he had counted around 30 bodies laid out. Syria's nearly six-year war has created a patchwork of areas of control across the country, and Azaz is a major stronghold of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA). \n The FSA is an alliance of moderate rebel groups whose fighters have, with Turkish military support, pushed Islamic State militants out of the border area.  Saturday's explosion was heard across the border in the Turkish town of Kilis, Dogan said. Anadolu said 23 wounded people had been taken by ambulance to Kilis hospital, one of whom subsequently died. \n Southeast of Azaz, Turkish forces have launched an offensive to take back the Islamic State-held town of al-Bab.  In a round-up of its military operations in support of rebels in northern Syria, the Turkish military said that on Friday 21 Islamic State militants had been killed in clashes. In a later statement, Turkey's army said that on Saturday one Turkish soldier was killed in clashes with the militants, while Turkish warplanes killed 37 militants, including three senior members of the group, in air strikes.

Tension between the two neighbours in the run-up to the U.S.-backed campaign to drive Islamic State from Mosul, which began in October, has been just one sign of the coming struggle for influence over Iraq's second city even once the jihadists have been driven out. The battle for the city has yet to be won but is beginning to make quicker progress. Iraqi counter-terrorism forces pushed to within several hundred metres (yards) of the Tigris and a strategic bridge on Saturday, the closest they have been, after staging an unprecedented nighttime assault the day before in a nearby district, a spokesman said. Advances in recent days have driven militants out of several additional areas east of the river. The counter-terrorism service (CTS) spokesman said new tactics and better coordination were helping. \"Counter-terrorism forces have been sent about 500 metres from the fourth bridge,\" Sabah al-Numan told reporters east of Mosul. A coalition spokesman said on Twitter that Islamic State had damaged the fourth bridge in a \"desperate act\" as they lost ground. The bridge has already been hit by U.S.-led air strikes to prevent the militants sending reinforcements across the city. CTS seized the Ghufran district, also known as al-Baath, and entered adjacent Wahda, Numan said. A separate military statement said Iraqi federal police had recaptured a hospital complex in Wahda in southeastern Mosul, a significant turnaround after U.S.-backed army units were forced to withdraw from the site last month under fierce counter-attacks from Islamic State. \n CTS and federal police \"are now moving in parallel on both axes\" in southeastern Mosul, Numan said. \"We are proceeding side by side ... and advancing at the same level. This is a very important factor, thanks to which Daesh (Islamic State) has not been able to move its fighters. It has to support one axis (front) at the expense of another.\" \"We have worn down the terrorist organisation with this type of advance.\" TURKISH WITHDRAWAL DISCUSSED \n Senior CTS commanders met on Saturday at a makeshift outpost in eastern Mosul where life in areas recaptured from Islamic State is slowly returning to normal despite heavy damage to homes and infrastructure. Residents lined the streets and vendors sold produce, eggs and meat in areas where clashes raged just a few weeks earlier. \n One of the generals handed out chocolates to neighbourhood children beside a column of black Humvees as the distant sound of explosions rang out. Friday's nighttime operation, launched after a week of planning, had been a particular success, Numan said. CTS forces using night-vision equipment crossed the Khosr river, a tributary that runs perpendicular to the Tigris through eastern Mosul, via a makeshift earth bridge after Islamic State had destroyed permanent ones, he said. Air strikes from the U.S.-led coalition sped that advance into Muthanna district. The CTS and federal police are part of a 100,000-strong Iraqi force made up of the military, Kurdish fighters and Shi'ite militias, backed by U.S.-led coalition air power. Some Sunni Muslim and Kurdish peshmerga units participating in the campaign received training from by Turkish forces at the Bashiqa camp northeast of Mosul. \n Turkey's military presence in northern Iraq since well before the Mosul campaign has angered Baghdad, and the two countries traded barbs over the issue shortly before it began on Oct. 17. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Baghdad reached an agreement with Ankara on Saturday over Iraq's request that Turkish forces withdraw. He gave no details of the deal, which he announced during a visit to Baghdad by Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. Yildirim said at a news conference with Abadi: \"We discussed the issue of Bashiqa.\" \"We see that significant progress is being made in cleansing Daesh from the region. In line with this, we will solve this (Bashiqa) subject somehow in a friendly way.\" A joint communique issued after the prime ministers met said the countries had agreed to respect each other's territorial integrity, and noted that Bashiqa was \"an Iraqi camp\".  Yildirim also welcomed recent Abadi remarks that Iraq would not allow the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to harm Turkey from Iraqi territory. \"This shows in the best way what we can do together and against terror,\" he said. Turkey is trying to keep Kurdish militants away from its borders in both Iraq and Syria, fearing their presence could embolden its own Kurdish insurgency. It also has historical ties to northern Iraq and Mosul, and is seeking to maintain influence there, especially against a Shi'ite-dominated Baghdad government.

As part of the discussion, prosecutors also said that a witness feared retribution from Durst and had asked to testify without revealing his or her identity. Defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin said that allowing testimony from witnesses who were concealing their identities presumes that Durst was indeed involved in his wife's disappearance, in violation of the U.S. Constitution's rule that defendants are presumed to be innocent unless proven guilty in court.   \n But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mark Windham agreed to allow both the videotaped interviews and the incognito testimony of the witness. A second witness is also expected to ask for such confidentiality. \"This is an opportunity to test the veracity of these witnesses,\" Windham said. His lawyers argued that Durst was too old and frail to harm the two potential witnesses who are seeking to testify privately. But prosecutors disagreed, pointing to Durst's estimated net worth of $100 million as evidence that he could simply hire someone to harm the witnesses. \n Durst was formally charged with the Berman murder a day after HBO aired the final episode of \"The Jinx,\" in which Durst was recorded muttering to himself off-camera: \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" Berman, 55, was found shot dead in her Los Angeles home, reportedly execution style, not long after police in New York reopened their investigation into the 1982 disappearance and presumed killing of his wife, Kathleen. \n Durst was questioned but never charged in that probe.

During Sanders' campaign for the presidential nomination, he proposed replacing Obamacare with a government-run single-payer health insurance system based on Medicare, the government plan for elderly and disabled Americans. \n \"In the 'dissatisfied' column are a whole bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters who wanted a single-payer plan,\" Obama said in the interview. \"The problem is not that they think Obamacare is a failure. The problem is that they don't think it went far enough and that it left too many people still uncovered,\" Obama said. \n Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, agreed that many people would rather the government \"take on the private insurance industry and the pharmaceutical companies\" and play a bigger role in providing healthcare. \"There are many millions of Americans, including many of Bernie's supporters, who don\u2019t understand why we are the only major country on earth that does not provide healthcare as a right and they don\u2019t understand why we pay more but get less for what we spend on healthcare,\" Briggs said. Polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation last month showed 46 percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Obamacare, while 43 percent have a favorable view. Americans are also split on whether the law should be repealed. \n Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to quickly repeal the law, but Obama and Democrats have argued they should reveal a replacement plan before dismantling the program. More than 20 million previously uninsured Americans gained health coverage through Obamacare, according to the White House. Coverage was extended by expanding the Medicaid program for the poor and through online exchanges where consumers can receive income-based subsidies.

A portion of the ordeal was broadcast on the Facebook Live service, drawing widespread shock and condemnation. By Jan. 2, the victim's mother had grown concerned after not hearing from her son. She was able to contact Hill through social media and asked for her son to be returned. This angered Hill, assistant state's attorney Erin Antonietti told members of the media outside the court on Friday. The victim is schizophrenic and suffers from attention deficit disorder, Antonietti said. \n She said Hill took the victim to an apartment where he was bound, gagged, beaten and stabbed with a knife while his assailants streamed the incident online. They also shouted obscenities about President-elect Donald Trump and \"white people.\" \"The victim is screaming 'no' in fear when a male walks over to him with a knife and states, 'Should I shank his ass?'\" Antonietti said, quoting a statement that she had read earlier in court. \n During the attack, Hill contacted the victim's mother and demanded $300 in exchange for her son, Antonietti said. Police located the victim on Tuesday after neighbors complained about noise coming from the apartment. He was disoriented and wearing shorts in freezing weather, police said. The four are scheduled to appear next in court on Jan. 27.  (Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago; Editing by Sharon Bernstein and Richard Chang)",

The same jury that found Roof, 22, guilty last month of 33 federal charges including hate crimes heard a third day of raw testimony from the survivors of victims in the June 2015 massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. \"My heart is broken,\" said Malcolm Graham, brother of librarian Cynthia Hurd, who was among those killed after welcoming Roof to the evening Bible study meeting where he opened fire. \"Cynthia was easygoing, my motivator, my example.\" Family and friends attending the penalty phase of Roof's trial sobbed at the memories of victims including Ethel Lance, a matriarch whose family was left in \"tattered pieces\" by her death, daughter Sharon Risher said. Susie Jackson, 87, the oldest victim, \"had an unconditional love for everyone\" despite living through decades of racial discrimination, grandson Walter \"Bernie\" Jackson Jr. testified. \n Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Joseph Hamski provided more insight into Roof's motivation to kill, outlining references he made to racist and white supremacist groups in writings jail officers found in his cell in August 2015. Roof's comments appeared to be a continuation of the racist manifesto police found in his car when he was arrested the day after the shooting. \"I was unable to finish before because I was in a hurry to get to Charleston,\" Roof wrote from his cell, before stating his belief that Jews, Hispanics and Muslims posed a threat to white people. \n \"I did what I thought would make the biggest wave,\" Roof wrote, noting he had no remorse. \"And now the fate of our race sits in the hands of my brothers who continue to live freely.\" A few months before the shooting, Roof also posted his views on the white supremacist website Stormfront, Hamski said. \n \"I consider myself well-versed in racism,\" Roof wrote on the site, according to evidence displayed on a courtroom screen. Some people he corresponded with there said they wanted to meet him, but the agent did not say if any meetings took place. Roof is representing himself during the sentencing phase and does not plan to present any evidence in his defense. Testimony is expected to conclude on Monday.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said it was \"common\" procedure for all politically-appointed ambassadors to step down as a new U.S. administration comes in on Jan. 20. \n \"All political appointees for the Obama administration were directed to submit their resignation and the due date was Dec. 7, and the resignations are to take effect on Jan. 20,\" Kirby told reporters. \"That is common, typical practise ... that's the way it works.\" Kirby said, as expected, no career diplomats serving as ambassadors had been asked to resign by the transition team.  He acknowledged, however, that in the past there had been exceptions made for a small number of political appointees to stay on for a short time for personal reasons. \"But that is totally in the prerogative of the incoming administration,\" he added.  \n The order could leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain, the New York Times reported. A senior Trump transition official told the newspaper there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring Obama's overseas envoys leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do.    \n Trump has taken a strict stance against leaving any of Obama's political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20, aiming to break up many of his predecessor's signature foreign and domestic policy achievements, the newspaper said. Diplomats told the New York Times that the order has thrown their personal lives into a tailspin, leaving them scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to stay in their countries so their children can remain in school.

Some members complained about long lines at polling stations while others cited concerns over Russian attempts to influence the result in Trump's favor. \n \"I object because people are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our election,\" said  Representative Barbara Lee of California before being overruled. Biden denied the objections one by one, at times jocular and apparently determined to finish the tally. \"It is over,\" he said at one point, to laughter from Republicans. None of the representatives had the backing of a senator, which would have allowed them to suspend the joint session and allow the House and Senate to meet separately to debate the objections. \n Although Trump, who is set to take office on Jan. 20, won the Electoral College vote that determines the victor, Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The election has been shadowed by concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic groups and other forms of intervention during the campaign. Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed possible Russian interference, was due to receive a U.S. intelligence report on the situation later on Friday. He told The New York Times on Friday that the focus on the issue was a \"political witch hunt.\" \n The intelligence agencies did not conclude that Russian hacking changed any vote tallies. But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said concerns about Russian interference cast a pall over the 2016 vote. \"That's why people have some level of dismay today on the vote ... about the Electoral College,\" Pelosi said at a news conference. \"How much is known about the foreign disruption of our election?\"    (Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Susan Cornwell; Additional reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Leslie Adler)",

Satire of ISIS wives stirs anger and praise \"By October, it had become clear that the Russians were trying to help the Trump campaign,\u201d said one official familiar with the full report speaking on the condition of anonymity because the complete version is Top Secret. In some cases, one official said, the material followed what was called \u201ca circuitous route\u201d from the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, to WikiLeaks in an apparent attempt to make the origins of the material harder to trace, a common practice used by all intelligence agencies, including U.S. ones. These handoffs, the officials said, enabled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to say the Russian government or state agencies were not the source of the material published on his website. \n In an interview with Fox News this week, Assange said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and Clinton aide John Podesta from \"a state party.\" Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Details of the report emerged as the top U.S. intelligence official, James Clapper, said on Thursday he was \"even more resolute\" in his belief that Russia staged cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 election campaign. Not all 17 intelligence agencies participated in preparing the assessment. An unclassified version of the report is expected to be released on Friday morning, two officials said. \n The report contains some of what the officials called \u201cminor footnotes\u201d about open questions and other uncertainties, in part because some of the evidence supporting the conclusion is inferential. One such example, the officials said, was that intercepted messages and conversations among senior Russian officials in Putin\u2019s inner circle indicated they were aware of the hacking campaign and celebrated Trump\u2019s election as a victorious end to the campaign. The officials declined to discuss the nature of the communications, including whether they were domestic, international, or both. \"People who knew what this was about were celebrating a victory over the United States,\u201d said one official. \n Another example of inferential evidence, the officials said, was that as time passed and the early leaks attracted media attention that undermined or eclipsed Clinton\u2019s campaign, the Russians increasingly focused their hacking \u201calmost exclusively\u201d on Democratic rather than Republican targets. There was also strong resemblance -- including the use of the same computer malware -- the Russians have used against targets in Europe and the marriage of traditional espionage tactics used by Soviet and Russian intelligence such as bribery, blackmail and internet vulnerabilities, which they said Putin has devoted increasing resources and attention to exploiting. For example, one official said, the Democratic databases and email servers the Russians hacked also contained personal information that WikiLeaks has not published. Such information could be used to search for financial, medical, browsing history and other records that can be used to target individuals for recruiting efforts by Russian spies.

Separately, the envoys of 10 other nations were called in to the Israeli Foreign Ministry to be reprimanded on Sunday, and Netanyahu had more harsh words for Washington over Friday's U.N. vote. An Israeli spokesman gave no details of when Netanyahu would meet U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro.  The resolution was passed in the 15-member Security Council because the U.S. broke with its long-standing approach of diplomatically shielding Israel and did not wield its veto power, instead abstaining. Netanyahu put his personal imprint on Israel's show of anger by repeating at the weekly cabinet meeting what an unidentified Israeli government official contended on Friday - that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama had conspired with the Palestinians to push for the resolution's adoption. The White House has denied the allegation. \n \"According to our information, we have no doubt the Obama administration initiated it (the resolution), stood behind it, coordinated the wording and demanded it be passed,\" Netanyahu told the cabinet in public remarks. Another official said Netanyahu had ordered that for the coming three weeks, until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, cabinet ministers refrain from traveling to or meeting officials of countries that voted in favor of the resolution. The envoys from 10 of the 14 countries that voted for the resolution and have embassies in Israel - Britain, China, Russia, France, Egypt, Japan, Uruguay, Spain, Ukraine and New Zealand - were summoned to the Foreign Ministry. \n Sunday is a regular work day in Israel, but most embassies are closed, and calling in envoys on Christmas Day is highly unusual. At the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu described a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, when Israel and President-elect Donald Trump successfully pressed Egypt to drop the anti-settlement resolution it had put forward. It was resubmitted a day later by New Zealand, Senegal, Venezuela and Malaysia. \n \"Over decades American administrations and Israeli governments disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the security council was not the place to resolve this issue,\" Netanyahu said. \"We knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace farther away. As I told John Kerry on Thursday, 'Friends don't take friends to the Security Council',\" he said, switching from Hebrew to English. Israel has pursued a policy of constructing settlements on territory it captured in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors - the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, areas Palestinians seek for a state. Most countries view the settlement activity as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees, citing biblical and historical connections to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as security interests.  (Additional reporting by Ori Lewis; editing by Andrew Roche)",

Chile's National Emergency Office (ONEMI) lifted both the evacuation order and a tsunami watch three hours after the Christmas Day quake struck, telling nearly 5,000 people who had evacuated they could return to their homes.  Onemi said one bridge in the area was impassable and some roads were closed as crews worked to restore electricity to some 21,000 homes left without power.  Officials had issued a tsunami warning earlier for areas within 1,000 km (621 miles) of the epicenter, just 39 km (24.5 miles) southwest of Quellon, off the coast. But the warning was downgraded to a tsunami watch. Eight mostly small ports in the area were closed, Chile's Navy said.  \"It's great news that as of now, we don't have to mourn any deaths as a result of the earthquake in the south,\" Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said on Twitter. \"Our goal is to reestablish normalcy in the affected communities.\"  The quake was felt on the other side of the Andes mountains in Argentina, in the southwestern city of Bariloche, but structural damage in areas close to the epicenter was limited, witnesses said.  The quake was relatively shallow, at a depth of about 34.6 km (21.5 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  \n \"There was a lot, a lot of movement here, but besides that nothing of note, there weren't houses falling,\" said Alamiro Vera, owner of the Cabanas Hotel in Quellon. \"It was just scary, and some things inside fell.\"  Alvarado, 46, said she was preparing to travel to the countryside to celebrate Christmas with friends when she felt the quake and ran out of her home.  \"All of a sudden it shook and shook and shook,\" Alvarado told Reuters. \"I thought the house would fall and the ground would open because it was very strong and very loud.\"  Though there were dozens of weaker aftershocks, damage was concentrated along a highway that runs across Chiloe Island, where traffic was shut in one section and on smaller roads and bridges.  Local television showed damage to some homes, especially in Quellon and surrounding areas.  \n Chile, located on the so-called \"Pacific Ring of Fire,\" has a long history of deadly quakes, including a 8.8 magnitude quake in 2010 off the south-central coast, which also triggered a tsunami that devastated coastal towns.  But death and destruction are limited by strict construction codes especially designed to withstand earthquakes.  SALMON ZONE \n The area hit by Sunday's quake was south of Valdivia, Chile, where 1,655 people died in a magnitude 9.5 quake in 1960, ranked by the USGS as the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world. \n The region is home to several industrial salmon farms, but there were no signs of structural damage at farms or processing plants, said Jose Miguel Burgos, director of the National Fish and Aquaculture Service, a government agency.  \"Damage was limited, and neither fishing nor aquaculture activity will be affected by this event,\" Burgos said.  Fishing and agriculture company Empresas AquaChile SA said its employees in the watch zone had been evacuated and were safe, adding that there was no damage to its facilities.   Several other companies have industrial salmon farming operations in the region, including Blumar SA, Cia Pesquera Camanchaca SA, Australis Seafoods SA, Multiexport Foods SA, Invermar SA, and the local unit of Norway's Marine Harvest ASA. Chile is the world's leading copper producer, but there are no major mines located near the zone affected by the earthquake.  Chile's state-run oil company ENAP [ENAP.UL] said its Bio Bio refinery in southern Chile was operating normally. The Puerto Montt airport was operating normally, a spokesman said.  Latam Airlines Group SA and Sky Airlines said their southern Chile routes were operating without major delays.

A recipient of the U.S. State Department's \"Women of Courage\" award in 2015, Capt.

Mohammad Radmanish, a defense ministry spokesman, said the government hoped that her request would be denied by U.S. authorities who have spent billions trying to build up Afghan security forces. \"When an officer complains of insecurity and is afraid of security threats, then what should ordinary people do?\" he said. \"She has made an excuse for herself, but we have hundreds of educated women and female civil right activists who work and it is safe for them.\" \n Capt. Rahmani, who graduated from flight school in 2012 and qualified to fly C-208 military cargo aircraft, had been in the United States on a training course and had been due to return home on Saturday. In a conservative country notorious for the restrictions placed on women, Rahmani's story stood out as a rare example of a woman breaking through in areas normally reserved for men. \n Her success came at a price, however. The citation for the \"Women of Courage\" award said she and her family had received direct threats not just from the Taliban but also from some relatives, forcing her family to move house several times. However, there was little sympathy on Afghanistan's active social media networks, which were replete with comments criticizing Rahmani, accusing her of wasting government money spent on expensive training and avoiding her responsibilities. \n \"Niloofar Rahmani took a million dollars from the pockets of the people of Afghanistan to pay human traffickers to get to America to seek asylum,\" one Facebook user wrote in comments typical of others. Dozens of Afghan troops receiving training in the United States have gone missing over the past two years, and at least one has been detained while trying to cross the border to Canada.

On Sunday, he also called for an end to \"fundamentalist terrorism\" in Nigeria, a reference to Boko Haram, which has killed 15,000 people and displaced more than two million during a seven-year insurgency to create an Islamic state.. Francis further appealed for an end to tensions between the government and opposition in Venezuela, for harmony in Colombia, which recently ended a civil war with FARC guerrillas, and an end to strife on the Korean peninsula and in Myanmar.

Before then, the family spent Christmas at Windsor where Elizabeth attended a service since the mid-1960s. It was unclear if Elizabeth had ever missed a Christmas Day service before. Philip was driven to church and walked in unaided, a Reuters photographer said, while Prince Charles, heir to the throne, walked to the church with his wife Camilla and other members of the family. \"The queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery,\" a palace spokesman said. \"Her Majesty will participate in the Royal Family Christmas celebrations during the day.\" \n Elizabeth's other children, Anne, Andrew and Edward attended along with Prince Harry, Charles's second son. Prince William, second-in-line to the throne, was spending Christmas with the parents of his wife, Kate. After more than six decades on the throne, the Queen has cut back on international tours but still regularly performs official duties around Britain, although she said on Tuesday she would reduce such visits. While Elizabeth's father, George VI, died at the relatively young age of 56, her mother, known as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived until 101 and was still appearing in public almost up until her death in 2002. \n \"GREAT LOVE\" \n Elizabeth has maintained the popularity of the monarchy despite years of political, social and cultural change since she became Queen Elizabeth II on Feb. 6, 1952, aged just 25.  In a pre-recorded Christmas broadcast, she invoked the example of Jesus and quoted the words of Mother Teresa to praise those who she said did small things with love. \n \"Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love,\" Elizabeth said. \"It's understandable that we sometimes think the world's problems are so big that we can do little to help.\"  \"On our own, we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice, but the cumulative impact of thousands of small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine.\" Elizabeth, the symbolic head of the Church of England, noted that despite Jesus's humble beginnings and maligned life, billions of people - including her - rely on his teachings and draw inspiration from his example. The Times reported on Wednesday that Philip carried out more public engagements last year than did his grandsons William and Harry, and William's wife Kate combined.

Anhui has reported five human infections since Dec. 8. Authorities in Anhui, which has a population of almost 60 million, have shut some livestock markets and stepped up sterilisation to prevent the virus spreading. \"A few\" chickens had been culled. \n In Xiamen, a city in Fujian province also in the east, authorities halted poultry sales on Thursday in one district, after a 44-year-old man was diagnosed with H7N9, state news agency Xinhua reported. The H7N9 strain does not seem to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human infection has not been reported, according to the World Health Organization. The danger with any such virus is that it mutates and acquires genetic changes that might increase its pandemic potential. \n The last major bird flu outbreak in mainland China - from late 2013 to early 2014 - killed 36 people and led to more than $6 billion in losses for the agricultural sector.

   "7. content": "By  Polina Devitt  and  Andrew Osborn \n |  MOSCOW \n \n MOSCOW  A Russian military plane carrying 92 people, including dozens of Red Army Choir singers, dancers and orchestra members, crashed into the Black Sea on its way to Syria on Sunday, killing everyone on board, Russian authorities said. The Russian Defence Ministry said one of its TU-154 Tupolev planes had disappeared from radar screens at 0525 MSK (9.25 p.m. ET), two minutes after taking off from Sochi in southern Russia, where it had stopped to refuel from Moscow, on its way to Syria. Major-General Igor Konashenkov, a ministry spokesman, told reporters that nobody had survived. \"The area of the crash site has been established. No survivors have been spotted,\" he said. An unnamed ministry source told Russian news agencies no life rafts had been found, while another source told the Interfax agency that the plane had not sent an SOS signal. In televised comments, President Vladimir Putin, speaking in St Petersburg, declared Dec. 26 a national day of mourning.  The jet, a Soviet-era Tupolev plane built in 1983, had been carrying 84 passengers and eight crew members. At least 60 were members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, better known internationally as the Red Army Choir, and were being flown out to Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria to entertain troops in the run-up to the New Year. Nine Russian reporters were also on board as well as military servicemen. \n Konashenkov said fragments of the plane had been found at a depth of about 70 meters (yards) in the Black Sea about 1.5 km (1 mile) off the coast near the city of Sochi. \"The search operation is continuing,\" said Konashenkov. \"Four ships, four helicopters, and a plane and a drone are working in the area,\" he said, saying a military commission had flown to Sochi to look into what happened. Six ships from Russia's Black Sea fleet were on their way to the crash site, and more than 100 divers were being drafted in to search the area along with a mini-submarine.   Konashenkov said four bodies had been recovered from the sea. Russian news agencies cited a higher figure.   \n Russia's RIA news agency, citing an unidentified security source, said preliminary information indicated that the plane had crashed because of a technical malfunction or a pilot error. Another source told Russian agencies that the possibility of a militant act had been ruled out. The weather had been good. Konashenkov said the plane had last been serviced in September and undergone more major repairs in December 2014. He said the pilot was experienced and that the plane had about 7,000 flying hours on its clock.  According to the defense ministry's passenger manifest, Elizaveta Glinka, a member of Putin's advisory human rights council, was on the plane.      Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters it was too early to say what had caused the crash. Putin was being kept constantly informed of the latest developments, Peskov said. \n Russian military investigators said in a statement they had opened a criminal investigation into the crash. The Kremlin said Putin expressed his deepest condolences to those who had lost loved ones in the crash and ordered Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to head a government investigatory commission. Russia's Defence Ministry regularly flies musicians into Syria to put on concerts for military personnel. The base they were heading for, Hmeymim, is in Latakia province. It is from there that Russia launches air strikes against Syrian rebels. The last big TU-154 crash was in 2010 when a Polish jet carrying then-president Lech Kaczynski and much of Poland's political elite crashed in western Russia killing everyone on board.  Russian news agencies cited Denis Manturov, the Russian Transport Minister, as saying on Sunday it was premature to talk about withdrawing the TU-154 from service.  On Dec. 19, a Russian military jet crashed in Siberia with 39 people on board as it tried to make an emergency landing near a Soviet-era military base. Nobody was killed in that incident, though 32 people were airlifted to hospital.    (Additional reporting by Denis Pinchuk and Svetlana Reiter; Editing by Louise Ireland)",

   "7. content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Signs of Esteban Santiago\u2019s unraveling had mounted over the past year. But it was not until early November, when he walked into an F.B.I. office carrying an ammunition clip \u2014 leaving a pistol and his infant son in his car \u2014 to complain about a C.I.A. plot against him, that his behavior became disturbing enough to earn him a short stay in a psychiatric hospital unit.   In the months before, the police were called repeatedly to his home about domestic disturbances, and the National Guard kicked him out because of \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d after nearly a decade of service. Mr. Santiago, an Iraq war veteran, increasingly spoke to relatives and associates about voices in his head that were tormenting him.   Then, a little before 1 p.m. Friday, Mr. Santiago, 26, turned up far from his Alaska home, in Terminal 2 of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. There, law enforcement officials said, he retrieved his checked luggage, pulled a 9-millimeter handgun out of his suitcase and used it to kill five people and wound six others, setting off a panic that shut down the airport.   After running out of ammunition, he lay spread-eagled on the floor, waiting quietly to be arrested, witnesses said.   Late Saturday afternoon, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida announced that Mr. Santiago had been arrested and charged on a federal criminal complaint \u201cin connection with the deadly shooting of multiple victims at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\u201d His first court appearance was scheduled for Monday morning before a federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale.   Law enforcement officials said they had not determined a motive or cause for the attack. And while they said they could not exclude the possibility of terrorism, the initial investigation suggested that Mr. Santiago had acted alone and that there was no evidence that he had terrorist ties.   \u201cIt\u2019s way too early for us to really rule out anything,\u201d George Piro, the agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s Miami office, said at a news conference here on Saturday.   But family members said they had a pretty good idea of what led to the attack.   \u201cHe said he heard certain voices, that the U.S. government wanted to enroll him in certain groups for ISIS, and he was very paranoid,\u201d Bryan Santiago Ruiz, an older brother of Mr. Santiago\u2019s, said in an interview on Saturday in Pe\u00f1uelas, the small town in Puerto Rico where they grew up.   Esteban Santiago lived in Anchorage, and Bryan Santiago said he had visited him there, most recently staying with him from August through October.   \u201cHe said that the C.I.A. controlled him through secret messages over the internet and told him the things he had to do,\u201d he recalled.   It was on Nov. 7 that Esteban Santiago went to the F.B.I. office in Anchorage \u201cto report that his mind was being controlled by U.S. intelligence agencies,\u201d Marlin L. Ritzman, the agent in charge of the office, said on Saturday. \u201cDuring the interview, Mr. Santiago appeared agitated, incoherent and made disjointed statements.\u201d   Elaborating, a senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago had claimed that the C.I.A. put terrorist propaganda on his computer.   F.B.I. agents called the local police, who took him to a psychiatric facility.   \u201cSantiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS,\u201d said Christopher Tolley, the Anchorage police chief, referring to the Islamic State.   When Mr. Santiago went into the F.B.I. office, he left a pistol and his newborn in his vehicle, Chief Tolley said, and he had an ammunition clip in his pocket.   The senior law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the gun was the same weapon used in the airport shooting on Friday.   The police confiscated the gun but returned it to Mr. Santiago in December, Chief Tolley said.   Bryan Santiago said his brother was held at the hospital for just a few days before being released and, as far as he knew, did not have any follow-up treatment, like medication or therapy.   The Fort Lauderdale airport reopened on Saturday, as the F.B.I. led an investigation that sprawled across the country and airport officials tried to reunite people with what they said were 20,000 items that had been recovered from the terminal, left behind by passengers and airport workers fleeing for their lives.   Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but was raised in Puerto Rico, where he joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007 before he finished high school. A classmate said he had always wanted to be a soldier.   In 2010, Mr. Santiago was deployed to Iraq for nine months, working with the 130th Engineer Battalion clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. His company was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.   Guard officials said at least two members of the company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is no record indicating that Mr. Santiago was ever involved in combat.   Family members said Mr. Santiago was never quite the same after his return.   \u201cAfter Iraq, something happened,\u201d Hernan Rivera, 70, Mr. Santiago\u2019s uncle, said Saturday afternoon as he stood in his driveway in Union City, N.J. \u201cWhen he came back from Iraq, he was a different person.\u201d   He described his nephew as a \u201cnormal kid\u201d who enjoyed reading.   \u201cHe was a person who used to talk a lot,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cAnd then when he came back, he kept to himself, he\u2019d go to his room, he wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody.\u201d   In 2014, Mr. Santiago moved to Alaska and joined the Alaska Army National Guard. He got a job as a security guard and found a girlfriend 14 years his senior. A few months ago, they had a baby; a law enforcement official said it was not clear whether that was the same child that he brought with him to the F.B.I. office in November.   In January 2016, the girlfriend told the police that Mr. Santiago had flown into a rage while she was using the bathroom, broke down the bathroom door and was \u201cstrangling her and smacking her in the side of the head\u201d while screaming at her, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. A month later, he was charged with violating a court order to stay away from his girlfriend after the police found that he had been living with her again.   In March, a deferred judgment was entered in the case, meaning that it could be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble, but the signs of unrest continued.   Chief Tolley said that once in March and twice in October, Mr. Santiago was the subject of domestic disturbance calls, but each time, officers lacked the basis for making an arrest.   In August, Mr. Santiago, who had reached the rank of private first class and had won several commendations for his earlier National Guard service \u2014 including the Army Good Conduct Medal \u2014 was discharged by the Alaska Guard for \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d   Despite the disturbing nature of the episode with the F.B.I. in November, it did not land Mr. Santiago on any law enforcement watch lists or on the federal \u201cno-fly\u201d list. Neither did it impede his right to possess a gun.   At a news conference on Saturday in Anchorage, officials with the F.B.I. and local law enforcement said that although Mr. Santiago was clearly incoherent during his encounter with F.B.I. agents, he was not deemed to be threatening.   In two other mass killings, perpetrators had drawn attention from the F.B.I. before carrying out their attacks.   Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June,  had fallen under F.B.I. scrutiny twice  for possible ties to terrorism.   And Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers who carried out the  Boston Marathon  bombing in 2013, was  interviewed by agents  looking into whether he had extremist tendencies, but their investigation of him ended there.   On Thursday night, Mr. Santiago boarded a flight in Anchorage, changed planes in Minneapolis on Friday morning, and flew into Fort Lauderdale. Law enforcement officials said that he had a semiautomatic handgun in his checked suitcase and that  he followed all legal procedures  for transporting the weapon. He went into a terminal restroom, took out the gun and loaded it, then returned to the baggage claim area and started shooting, officials said.   He apparently acted alone, Agent Piro said on Saturday, and \u201cthe early indication is that there was no specific reason that he chose Fort Lauderdale International Airport, but we\u2019re still pursuing that and trying to really determine why he came here.\u201d   \u201cThe suspect did cooperate with the interview team,\u201d which Agent Piro described as a joint effort by the F.B.I. and the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cThe interview went over several hours and concluded sometime this morning.\u201d   While people who knew Mr. Santiago recently saw anger, instability and paranoia, those who knew him earlier in his life had known someone very different.   Relatives and acquaintances in Puerto Rico remembered him as being quiet and shy \u2014 so reserved that in his hometown, Pe\u00f1uelas, on the island\u2019s southwest coast, few people knew anything about him.   Workers at the barbershop, the bakery and the furniture store, and parishioners at the churches near his family\u2019s home, said they did not know Mr. Santiago or his family at all. At the police station, officers said they did not recognize him from the photograph that has been shown repeatedly on network and cable television since his arrest.   A neighbor of the family\u2019s, Carlos Cruz, a man in his 50s who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life, said he remembered speaking with Mr. Santiago just once.   Those who did recall him described him as highly intelligent, kind and very quiet, part of a somewhat nerdy group who listened to American rock rather than music in Spanish. He spoke of joining the military, seeing it as a way out of the sleepy, economically stagnant region.   Rosemarie Zapata, 27, who attended middle school and high school with him, credited him with persuading her to join the Puerto Rico National Guard. At first, she failed the exam by two points, but it was Mr. Santiago who talked her into persevering and introduced her to his recruiter, she said.   \u201cHe told me, \u2018Study, go, they will help us pay for college, so why don\u2019t you try it out?\u2019\u201d she said. He convinced her that she could do it, saying, \u201cYou are going to defy all odds,\u201d she recalled.   Years later, she ran into him in a Walgreens parking lot, shortly after he had returned from Iraq.   \u201cHe was very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You would never want to go to Iraq. I saw horrible things, horrible.\u2019 He was very different. He was sad.\u201d   Delia Candelario, who went to Josefa V\u00e9lez Bauz\u00e1 High School with Mr. Santiago, said he played basketball with the best-behaved boys, who always followed the teachers\u2019 orders.   \u201cHe was the most peaceful of all of them,\u201d she said. \u201cHe participated in classes and all that, but he was pretty shy.\u201d   Another classmate, Joshua Ortiz, said Mr. Santiago was so quiet that when word got out that someone from their school had committed a massacre, hardly anyone could remember his name.   Mr. Santiago and his friends were \u201cnever known to be involved in any problem or any fight during the whole time we were in school,\u201d Mr. Ortiz said. \u201cWe wonder, how could his life have changed so much for this to have happened?\u201d   Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, who taught Mr. Santiago history at the school, said: \u201cHe was brilliant and did not show any indications of being disturbed. It\u2019s one of those strange cases. There are students who you expect mischief from, but not this one.\u201d",

But Hoeven has condemned protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, a movement led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux and joined by other Native Americans and allies from across the country. Protesters say a leak would be catastrophic for the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux and others, and argue that the construction violates an  1851 treaty with the U.S. government . In November,  Hoeven characterized the protests as sometimes \u201cviolent\u201d  and called for President  Barack Obama  to  approve the pipeline\u2019s final easement  and put an end to the demonstrations. Of course, there are Native Americans, including some members of the Standing Rock Sioux,  who do not agree with the protesters. But the fight against the pipeline is arguably the most prominent Native American-led social movement in recent history, and the protests have become emblematic of the  fight for Native American rights. Hoeven\u2019s views on the issue are also at odds with Udall\u2019s. After federal authorities announced a  halt to the pipeline\u2019s construction  in December, Udall applauded the decision. \u201cOver the last seven months, thousands of people, including Indian nations from New Mexico and across North America, have demonstrated their deep concern about the lack of consultation by the federal government and the potential environmental hazard this pipeline poses for the water,\u201d  Udall said in a statement. While many people  celebrated the decision to halt construction  as a major victory, it\u2019s  not totally clear what the future holds  for the project, especially with incoming president-elect  Donald Trump. Last month, Trump\u2019s transition team said he supported the pipeline and would review options when he takes office.

The report, compiled by the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, makes no judgments about the decisions that the agencies or the White House made as evidence of Russian activity mounted. But to anyone who reads between the lines and knows a bit of the back story not included in the report, the long lag times between detection and reaction are stunning.   The delays reveal fundamental problems with American cyberdefenses and deterrence that President-elect Donald J. Trump will begin to confront in two weeks, regardless of whether he continues to resist the report\u2019s findings about Russia\u2019s motives.   The intrusion hardly had the consequences of Pearl Harbor some 75 years ago, when the incoming force was seen on radar and dismissed. But it had similar characteristics. Then, as now, a failure of imagination about the motives and plans of a longtime adversary meant that government officials were not fully alert to the possibility that Mr. Putin might try tactics here that have worked so well for him in Ukraine, the Baltics and other parts of Europe.   And while American intelligence officials \u2014 who were focused primarily on the Islamic State and other urgent threats like China\u2019s action in the South China Sea and North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threat \u2014 saw what was happening, they came late to its broader implications.   It was telling that within an hour of the release of the report on Friday, the secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, declared for the first time that America\u2019s election system \u2014 the underpinning of its democracy \u2014 would be added to the list of \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d This after years of cyberattacks on campaigns and government agencies.   In the intelligence report\u2019s most glaring example of the government\u2019s lagging response, it says that \u201cin July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access to  Democratic National Committee  networks\u201d and stayed there for 11 months, roaming freely and copying the contents of emails that it ultimately released in the midst of the election. Classified briefings circulating in Washington indicate that British intelligence had alerted the United States to the intrusion by fall 2015.   Almost immediately, a low-level special agent with the F.B.I. alerted the Democratic National Committee\u2019s information technology contractor, which doubted the call and did nothing for months. The F.B.I. failed to escalate the issue, even though it was clear from the start that the attackers were almost certainly the same Russians who had mounted similar campaigns against the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   At a news conference in December, President Obama made it clear that he was not aware of any of this until mid-2016, nearly a year after the hacking began and the British had sent up a flare.   \u201cAt the beginning of the summer,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cwe\u2019re alerted to the possibility that the D.N.C. has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it\u201d and to brief \u201cpotential victims\u201d and \u201cthe relevant intelligence agencies.\u201d   It was not until Oct. 7, 2016, 15 months after the initial hacking attack, that the intelligence agencies first publicly blamed Russia. Even then, Mr. Obama made it clear that he did not want to escalate the situation before the election, for fear of getting into a tit-for-tat  cyberwar  in which Russia might try to alter the actual vote tallying. (It did not.)   \u201cWe were just too slow, at every turn,\u201d one of Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides said in an interview late last year.   The director of the N.S.A., Adm. Michael S. Rogers, has said the problem was hardly limited to this case. \u201cThe biggest frustration to me is speed, speed, speed,\u201d he told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, in response to a question from Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the panel, about the obstacles to seeing a threat from abroad and acting on it here in the United States.   \u201cWe have got to get faster; we\u2019ve got to be more agile,\u201d said Admiral Rogers, who clashed with White House officials when they thought he was acting too slowly against the Islamic State. \u201cWe can\u2019t be bound by history and tradition here. We have to be willing to look at alternatives.\u201d   Mr. Putin, for his part, played a weak hand skillfully, blending old information-warfare techniques with the echo chamber created by the internet. It is clear that Mr. Putin saw a huge vulnerability in the American system that was ripe to be exploited.   The country\u2019s highly partisan politics, with cable channels and websites devoted to pressing an agenda for the fully convinced and the half-convinced, made it more vulnerable to any disclosures that could capture a news cycle. Add to that the uniquely Russian combination of covert espionage and the disclosure of the emails it harvested, as well as the release of \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2014 compromising information about politicians and policy makers \u2014 and \u201cfake news,\u201d a tactic not above American officials at times.   As the report released on Friday makes clear, this is hardly the end of the story. Elections are coming up in France and Germany, where Mr. Putin has a great interest in the outcomes. Anything that weakens the NATO alliance, in the Kremlin\u2019s view, strengthens Russia\u2019s hand.   And then there is the next election cycle in this country.   Until now, when government officials thought about \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d they usually thought of physical places and things: the power grid, the cellphone network, airports and even historical sites, like the Washington Monument.   \u201cElection infrastructure is vital to our national interests, and cyberattacks on this country are becoming more sophisticated, and bad cyberactors \u2014 ranging from nation-states, cybercriminals and hacktivists \u2014 are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.   The same words could have been written after the Chinese went into the networks of Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign and that of his Republican opponent in 2008, Senator John McCain of Arizona. They could have been written after the Iranians responded to the American-Israeli attack on their nuclear facilities by attacking American banks, or when the North Koreans went after Sony Pictures Entertainment in retaliation for a comic film that envisioned the assassination of Kim Jong-un, the nation\u2019s leader.   And the warning about Russia \u2014 a public intelligence report like the one issued on Friday \u2014 might have been written after the F.S.B. and the G.R.U., the two major Russian intelligence agencies, struck the computer systems of the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Instead, the government decided not to publicly name who had been behind the attacks. That has changed, at least for now. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will decide that disclosure or silence is the best policy.",

The 2013 Supreme Court ruling  freed states with a history of voter discrimination  from having to get DOJ approval to change election laws. Following the decision, scores of states and localities rushed to pass voter ID and other measures that voting rights advocates say disenfranchise minorities. The Texas lawsuit, filed on behalf of Latino voters in Pasadena, accused Mayor Johnny Isbell and members of the City Council of manipulating the districting system in order to keep Latinos from gaining seats on the City Council. Latinos make up  62 percent of the population of Pasadena , a city of 150,000 outside Houston, but turnout lags behind white voters. Isbell, a Republican, faced challenges in recent years to his party\u2019s hold on power as the city\u2019s Hispanic population grew. With only a one-vote majority on the City Council, he led an effort four years ago to  change the electoral system . Instead of electing City Council members by districts, which gave areas with a Hispanic majority a better chance of electing Latino officials, Isbell pushed a hybrid system with six single-member districts and two-at large districts, which would be elected by the public as a whole. Voters approved the redistricting changes in a tight referendum election in 2013. An estimated 99.6 percent of the city\u2019s Latino voters opposed the changes, according to Friday\u2019s ruling by  U.S. Chief District Judge Lee Rosenthal. The ruling also describes how after the referendum, Council Member Pat Van Houte, a Democrat, criticized the changes before the City Council. Isbell had police escort her out of the building for violating a new rule limiting floor speeches to three minutes on any given topic. In addition to requiring DOJ clearance, Friday\u2019s ruling forces Pasadena to abandon the redistricting plan and go back to its previous system \u2014 a map used in the 2013 election made up of eight single-member districts. Rosenthal called that the \u201cless intrusive remedy\u201d that gives the Pasadena City Council a chance to course-correct in time for its May 2017 election. But the pre-clearance requirement is indeed the heavier burden. \u201cAny new City Council voting map, plan, or procedure may be enforced before court review only if it has first been submitted to the United States Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within 60 days after submission,\u201d Rosenthal ordered. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the city will  appeal . The lead attorney representing the city of Pasadena,  C. Robert Heath, told The Houston Chronicle  they would need to study the ruling before making a decision. \u201cCertainly, I do think that the plan doesn\u2019t result in dilution of the Hispanic vote,\u201d Heath told the Chronicle. \u201cAs the evidence showed there were more Hispanics elected under the 6-2 plan than were ever elected under the 8-0 plan. ... But the judge obviously disagreed.\u201d \n The closely watched case may have implications for other parts of the country \u2015 especially the South, where jurisdictions have changed electoral systems after the 2013 VRA case. \u201cThe Court\u2019s well-reasoned decision is a clear warning to other jurisdictions that might seek to limit Latino voting power by taking advantage of the Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling of the protections of pre-clearance in the notorious  Shelby County  case,\u201d Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement. \u201cThe decision is also a repudiation of those, including congressional leaders, who facilely assert that intentional vote discrimination no longer occurs and that the protections of pre-clearance are no longer needed.\u201d \n Cristian Farias contributed reporting. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our  terms.

One anchor , however, quit her job during a live broacast in 2014, after saying she could no longer work for a network that \u201cwhitewashes the actions of Putin.\u201d   In the United States, RT America is broadcast by cable companies in some cities, is carried by Dish, the satellite television provider, and can be found free online. Larry King, the former CNN host, and Ed Schultz, a former MSNBC host, both have programs on the network.   The role of RT in the Kremlin\u2019s effort to influence the election is covered in more detail than any other part of Russia\u2019s campaign in the report, released by the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence  on Friday.   According to the report, the network aggressively uses the internet and social media to conduct \u201cstrategic messaging for the Russian government.\u201d RT videos receive more than one million views a day on YouTube, according to the report, and the network\u2019s programming was \u201caimed at undermining viewers\u2019 trust of US democratic procedures.\u201d   The report\u2019s assessment  of RT is an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for national security adviser. General Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT\u2019s news programs, and in December 2015 the network paid him to give a speech in Russia and attend a lavish anniversary party, where he sat next to Mr. Putin. General Flynn has since defended that speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC.   Mr. Trump also appeared on Mr. King\u2019s program, \u201cPoliticking,\u201d during the campaign.   On Friday, Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, posted a  message  to Twitter that mocked the American report.   \u201cAaa, the C.I.A. report is out!\u201d she wrote. \u201cLaughter of the year! Intro to my show from 6 years ago is the main evidence of Russia\u2019s influence at US elections. This is not a joke!\u201d   Analysts say Russia lacks the economic and military power to combat NATO, the European Union or the United States directly. The country has instead invested in \u201cweaponized\u201d information, using hacking, propaganda and other means to sow doubt and division in other countries. The goal is to weaken cohesion among Western allies, stir discord in their domestic politics and blunt opposition to Russia.   Last year,  Swedish authorities  said they traced to Russia a disinformation campaign when Sweden was considering cooperating militarily with NATO.   Russian intelligence agents used a variety of means to spread misinformation. \u201cWe mean everything from internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik,\u201d Wilhelm Unge, a spokesman for the Swedish Security Service, said during a speech to that agency last year.   In 2014, Russian news media produced multiple theories about the destruction of  Malaysia Airlines F light 17  over Ukraine, blaming the C.I.A. and Ukrainian fighter pilots who had mistaken the airliner for the Russian presidential aircraft. Separate  Dutch  and  Ukranian  inquiries concluded that Russian-backed insurgents had accidentally shot down the plane with a missile they got from Russia.   That same year, an RT America anchor quit during a live broadcast to protest the network\u2019s coverage of Russia\u2019s invasion and occupation of Crimea. \u201cPersonally, I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government which whitewashes the actions of Putin,\u201d said  Liz Wahl . Another anchor,  Abby Martin  quit some months after denouncing Russia\u2019s incursion on air. \u201cWhat Russia did was wrong,\u201d Ms. Martin said.   It is not clear how many people RT and Sputnik reach. The numbers released by the Broadcasters\u2019 Audience Research Board in Britain for the week of the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in late June, a week of particularly heavy TV watching nationwide, for example, showed it had 926,000 viewers, or 1.57 percent of the audience.",

There will be hearings  on six nominees  on Wednesday alone. Trump himself faces numerous questions about his business ties and  extensive  potential  conflicts  of  interest . He  refused  to release his tax returns during the presidential campaign and has continued to do so even after winning the presidency. Shaub wrote that he was unaware of an instance in the four decades OGE has existed in which potential cabinet picks had gone before the Senate before being fully vetted. \u201cThis normally intensive process has been further complicated by both the Senate hearing  schedule and the announcement of nominees prior to consulting OGE for an evaluation of any  ethics issues. In the past, the ethics work was fully completed prior to the announcement of  nominees in the overwhelming majority of cases,\u201d he wrote. In a Saturday statement, Schumer said the letter \u201cmakes crystal clear that the transition team\u2019s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they\u2019ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.\u201d \n OGE emails  that MSNBC obtained  through a public records request showed that the ethics office had lost contact with Trump after repeatedly trying to contact them in November. The emails showed Shaub warning Trump transition officials that they were risking embarrassing the president-elect by announcing cabinet picks before notifying OGE. Without receiving guidance, White House staff could also violate conflict of interest laws. Officials at the OGE also warned the transition team they needed to consult with the office before putting assets in a blind trust and that it could block such an arrangement if the office did not feel the trustees were truly \u201cindependent.\u201d \n Trump is expected to hold a press conference Wednesday to detail how he would resolve his business ties.

The ban came less than a week after Republicans took control over all three branches of Kentucky government. Before the November election, Republicans had not controlled the Kentucky House since 1921. Anti-abortion advocates argue that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, but that claim  isn\u2019t supported by medical evidence . Reproductive rights advocates worry that 20-week bans could be used as a  vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade , the landmark case that protects a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion. Nearly 20 states have passed 20-week abortion bans. The Kentucky legislature  also passed a separate bill  Saturday that requires a woman to have an ultrasound before she receives an abortion. Bevin is also expected to sign that bill. ACLU-KY Advocacy Director Kate Miller condemned both bills. \u201cThe passage today of 20 week abortion ban, Senate Bill 5 and mandated ultrasound bill, House Bill 2, were the culmination of a week where many members of the General Assembly worked at breakneck speed to severely restrict women\u2019s reproductive rights,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn floor speech after floor speech  Saturday , lawmakers discussed the true intention of their support of the bills, which was simply banning abortion. Senate Bill 5 and House Bill 2 are not about women\u2019s health. They represent nothing more than political intrusion in the most personal, private decisions.\u201d \n Neither the 20-week abortion ban nor the ultrasound bill contains exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Both measures moved remarkably quickly through the Kentucky legislature, which opened its session on Tuesday. The laws contain emergency language that will make them effective immediately once they are signed,  the Lexington Herald Leader  reported earlier this week. The ACLU of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood have criticized how quickly the 20-week ban moved through the legislature. Demonstrators took to the state capitol building in Frankfort this week to protest the bill. \u201c Things are moving so quickly, members of the public and press were unable to obtain copies of the 20-week abortion ban and ultrasound bills before they received a reading and were headed to committee for a vote.\u201d \n Lawmakers are also considering a different measure that would block state and  local funds  from going towards funding any organization that provides abortion services.

Since then, Afghan forces, suffering from leadership woes and plagued by corruption, have struggled to hold territory, with district after district falling to the Taliban. For months now, the insurgents have been at the gates of the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.   The Afghan military welcomed the news of the Marines\u2019 return.   \u201cWe have been asking our foreign counterparts in security meetings to increase the level of their troops in Helmand Province to help us on the battlefields,\u201d said Shakil Ahmad, an Afghan Army spokesman. Mr. Ahmad said the security situation in region was rapidly deteriorating.   The Taliban appeared unfazed by the news of the Marines\u2019 return. \u201cOur mujahedeen continued their progress in the presence of tens of thousands of Americans and other invading forces,\u201d said Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman. \u201cA few hundred other soldiers won\u2019t become an obstacle on the way of our progress.\u201d   Fewer than 8,400 American troops are currently in Afghanistan, deployed either through NATO to train Afghan forces or as part of a smaller American counterterrorism mission. President Obama declared the United States combat mission in Afghanistan over in December 2014. But in the past year, as violence has spread across the country, the line for the American military between consulting and fighting has increasingly blurred.   At the peak of a troop surge in 2011, there were about 20,000 Marines fighting across Helmand alongside thousands of British soldiers. Western troops fought the Taliban village to village, and tried to win civilians\u2019 hearts and minds by doling out cash for bridges and roads.   The Taliban recently told Lashkar Gah residents to store food items, warning that they would once again cut off Helmand\u2019s main highway to the regional economic hub, Kandahar Province.   Unlike in the past, fighting between government troops and the Taliban has not diminished with the coming of this year\u2019s winter. Many fear that when fighting intensifies in the spring, the Taliban will be starting from a position of strength around several provincial capitals.   Ensuring that Afghan leaders take advantage of the winter to improve leadership and root out corruption will be critical to how they tackle Taliban pressure in the spring, American officials said.",

Lauderdale for the attack, but for months, he appeared to be having mental issues. The Iraq War veteran\u2019s mother told reporters that he was suffering ever since he  saw a bomb explode  next to his friends. In November, he walked into an FBI office in Anchorage and said the CIA was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch Islamic State videos. Miami FBI Special Agent George Piro said Saturday that Santiago \u201cdid not intend to harm anyone\u201d at the time, but the interaction spooked agents enough that they called police. Santiago was then forced to undergo a mental health evaluation. He was also accused of attacking his girlfriend in a domestic violence case last year. In January of 2016,  according to charging documents  obtained by the Associated Press, his girlfriend told police that Santiago assaulted her while she was in the bathroom. She stated that he broke the door, strangled her and hit her on the side of the head. He was charged with fourth-degree assault and damage of property over $50, both misdemeanor crimes. A month later, police spotted him at his girlfriend\u2019s home, in violation of the no-contact order that was a condition of his release. Santiago\u2019s alleged history of domestic violence adds him to the  long list of mass shooters  who abuse their families before going on to attack the public. But despite all these run-ins with the law, Santiago was never on the no-fly list. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said there\u2019s an obvious gap in a system that allowed that gun on that plane. She said she wants to review firearm travel rules in Washington this year. \u201cWe can\u2019t travel with more than a certain amount of liquid because there was an individual on a flight who tried to use a small amount of liquid to detonate an explosive device,\u201d she said. \u201c We need to review not only the question of whether people should be able to travel with their firearms, but we need to take a hard look at the security around baggage claim areas.\u201d \n Santiago reportedly loaded his gun in the bathroom before opening fire on the baggage claim area of Terminal 2. The shooting Friday left five dead and six wounded. When police arrived less than two minutes later, he threw his empty weapon on the ground and lay down, witnesses told the Associated Press. The airport resumed some service Saturday as investigators continued to sweep Terminal 2. Heavy delays were expected for flights, and authorities were still going through thousands of pieces of luggage to get them back to their owners. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our  terms.

   "7. content": "ST. LOUIS \u2014 A school district that includes students from Ferguson, Mo., will continue for now its longstanding method of electing board members at large, despite a lawsuit claiming that the process is racially biased.   The lawsuit, filed by the  American Civil Liberties Union  in 2014 on behalf of the Missouri  N.A.A.C.P. , seeks what is known as a cumulative-voting process for the Ferguson-Florissant School District. Such a process would allow people to vote multiple times for an individual candidate, depending on how many seats were being contested.   Judge Rodney W. Sippel, of Federal District Court in St. Louis, ruled in favor of the N.A.A.C.P. in August. But in December, he allowed the district to delay adopting cumulative voting while it appealed his ruling. A three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals declined on Thursday to overturn that decision.   Cindy Ormsby, a lawyer for the school district, said that, with the court case unresolved, the board election in April would rely on the at-large voting process.   \u201cThis was absolutely the best thing to do, rather than seesaw back and forth between two election models,\u201d Ms. Ormsby said.   Tony Rothert, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of Missouri, said the appeals court ruling was disappointing but would \u201chave no impact on the ultimate resolution of the case.\u201d   \u201cThe court\u2019s decision that the election system violates the  Voting Rights Act  still stands,\u201d Mr. Rothert said. \u201cIt is troubling that the school board is more interested in preserving an electoral system that the court found dilutes the votes of African-Americans than in giving black voters an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, which underscores the importance of electing a responsive school board.\u201d   The suit was filed soon after the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old, by a white police officer in Ferguson in August 2014. The suit claimed that the district\u2019s practice of selecting board members at large had made it more difficult for black candidates to win election.   The district serves about 11,200 students from 11 municipalities, including part of Ferguson. Though its population is about evenly split between whites and blacks, nearly 80 percent of the public school students are black; many white children attend private and parochial schools.   In an at-large election, voters get as many votes as there are vacancies to fill. But a voter can cast no more than one vote for each candidate. In the cumulative process, voters get the same number of votes as vacancies, but can cast all of them for a single candidate if they choose.   Drew Penrose, legal director for the nonprofit FairVote, said 58 jurisdictions around the country now use cumulative voting because of lawsuits alleging Voting Rights Act violations. He said minority representation has increased in those jurisdictions.   When the suit was filed in Missouri, just one of the seven Ferguson-Florissant board members was black. Two more black members were added in later elections, and Ms. Ormsby said it was possible that African-Americans would hold four of the seven board seats after the vote in April.   \u201cIn my mind that pretty much makes the N.A.A.C.P.\u2019s lawsuit moot,\u201d she said.",

   "7. content": "BEIRUT \u2014  A car bomb ripped through a busy commercial district in a rebel-held Syrian town along the Turkish border Saturday, killing nearly 50 in a huge explosion that damaged buildings and left rescuers scrambling to find survivors amid the wreckage, opposition activists said.   Rescuers and doctors said the explosion was so large there were nearly 100 wounded and burned. Over 50 wounded were transported to the Turkish border town of Kilis for treatment, as local hospitals couldn't cope.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Locals said a rigged tanker caused the explosion and blamed Islamic State militants, who have carried out attacks in the town before. The militant group has been increasingly pressed in Syria and Iraq, and has escalated its attacks against Turkey \u2014 which backs Syrian opposition fighters in a campaign against the group in northern Syria.   Azaz, only a couple of miles from the Turkish border, is a key town on a route used by opposition fighters moving between Syria and Turkey, and is a hub for anti-government activists as well as many displaced from the recent fighting in Aleppo city. Activists say its pre-war population of 30,000 has swelled.   It is also sandwiched between rival groups, including Kurdish fighters to the west and Turkey-backed opposition groups to the east. Islamic State militants, who have tried to advance on the key border town before have been pushed back farther east in recent months in the Turkey-backed offensive.   The bomb went off early Saturday afternoon outside a local courthouse and security headquarters operated by the opposition fighters who control the town, resident and activist Saif Alnajdi told The Associated Press from Azaz.   \"It hit the busiest part of the town,\" Alnajdi said, referring to the administrative part of town.   A medical worker speaking to a local media outfit, al-Jisr, said many charred bodies, and body parts mixed with bones and mud, were piled up in local hospitals.   Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, said at least 48 people were killed, including 14 fighters and guards to the local courthouse. He said the explosion was caused by a rigged water or fuel tanker, which explained the large blast and high death toll. The activist-operated local Azaz Media center and Shabha Press put the death toll at 60, adding that search and rescue operations continued for hours after the explosion.   Alnajdi said rescue workers were still working to identify and remove the bodies from the area, suggesting that the death toll was not final. He said some of the severely wounded were transported across the border into the Turkish town of Kilis for treatment. The Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency said 53 wounded Syrians were brought to Kilis' local hospital for treatment, including five in critical condition, transferred to Gaziantep. The agency said one later died.   Media activist Baha al-Halabi, based in Aleppo province and who gathered information from Azaz residents, said witnesses reported many unidentified bodies. Footage shared online showed a large plume of black smoke rising above the chaotic street with the sound of gunfire in the background as onlookers gathered around the site. In one instance, a father ran away from the scene, carrying his child to safety.   The court house and the security headquarters were damaged, as well as the Red Crescent and municipality offices, according to activists in the area.   Many rebels and civilians who were pushed out of Aleppo city during a massive government offensive late last year have resettled in Azaz. Syrian Kurdish forces control territory to the west of Azaz, and have often tried advancing toward the town, causing friction with Turkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters. To the east, opposition fighters backed by Turkey have been pushing back Islamic State extremists, gaining territory and advancing on the IS-stronghold town of al-Bab, further east. Turkey considers Syria Kurdish factions there terrorists, linked to a local group it is battling at home.   A nationwide week-long cease-fire has mostly held across most of Syria after Russia and Turkey, who support opposite sides of the conflict, reached an agreement late December. It is set to pave the way for peace talks between Assad's government and the opposition in Kazakhstan later this month. The Islamic State group and al-Qaida-linked group Fatah al-Sham Front are not included in the deal, according to the Syrian government.   ___   Associated press writer Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul contributed to this report.",

Mr. Barata did not specify an exact cause of death.   His death was confirmed by Portugal\u2019s Socialist Party, The Associated Press reported. The party did not give further details.   Mr. Soares, a lawyer, was a relentless foe of the fascist government of Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, who ruled Portugal for more than 40 years. He was later the central figure in Portuguese politics after Salazar\u2019s successor, Marcello Caetano, was deposed in what became known as the  Carnation Revolution  of 1974.   (Originally a military-led coup, the revolt became a mass movement of civil unrest characterized by carnations that were handed out and placed in the barrels of soldiers\u2019 rifles and tanks.)   In the course of his career, Mr. Soares (pronounced SWAH-esh) suffered years of imprisonment, exile and political defeat. He served twice as prime minister, only to watch his country\u2019s first attempts at representative democracy fall apart amid bitter party feuds.   He fought his country\u2019s economic isolation and efforts to drag the revolution down anti-democratic paths. He also oversaw the granting of independence to Portugal\u2019s African colonies and the country\u2019s integration into the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.   Mr. Soares was an indefatigable political animal, always enthusiastically shaking hands, smiling and engaging with strangers even when he was not campaigning. He was known in Portugal as \u201csempre em p\u00e9,\u201d or always on his feet, after the toy that bounces back whenever it is knocked down.   \u201cThere are victories and defeats in politics,\u201d he said in 1986, \u201cand what is necessary is to maintain your convictions, to keep battling.\u201d   M\u00e1rio Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares was born in Lisbon on Dec. 7, 1924. His father,  Jo\u00e3o Lopes Soares , was an educator and a liberal republican government minister before Salazar came to power and later a fierce critic of the dictatorship, which jailed him numerous times.   Mr. Soares took to his father\u2019s path early on. He was first arrested at 19 as a leader of the democratic opposition at the University of Lisbon, where he earned degrees in philosophy and history. He obtained his law degree at the Sorbonne in Paris and set up a practice in Lisbon defending political prisoners.   He gained recognition \u2014 and the scorn of the dictatorship \u2014 for his work representing the family of Gen. Humberto Delgado, a popular opposition leader who was mysteriously murdered. Mr. Soares pushed the case in international courts, implicating members of the Salazar police, but the government eventually shelved the investigation.   His support of self-determination for Portugal\u2019s colonies earned him even more hostility from the regime. While running in a controlled legislative election in 1965, he called for an end to the colonial wars and for negotiations with African nationalists. While the state branded him a traitor, public opinion was already embracing his anticolonial views, and his popularity grew.   Mr. Soares started an underground Socialist movement after becoming disillusioned with the leadership of the Communist Party, then the only organized opposition in the country. He began a tour of Europe in 1967 to drum up support from other Socialists, but he was jailed on his return and, in March 1968, banished without trial to the remote equatorial island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9.   About six months later, Salazar became incapacitated after a stroke, and Caetano, his successor, initiated a slow political liberalization of the corporatist state. One of his first acts in 1968 was to authorize Mr. Soares\u2019s return to Portugal. ( Salazar died  in 1970 at 81.)   Instead of retreating, Mr. Soares continued his crusade against the dictatorship and its colonial wars, and within a year he was sent into exile again, this time in Europe.   In France, he secured part-time teaching jobs at the Sorbonne and the University of Rennes. He kept a modest apartment on the Left Bank in Paris, where he wrote about his struggles against fascism and bolstered the opposition among immigrants and other exiles. He also consolidated his ties with other Socialist leaders and announced the creation of the Portuguese Socialist Party during a conference in West Germany in 1973.   By the time the dictatorship fell in the bloodless Carnation Revolution of 1974, Mr. Soares had been jailed 12 times \u2014 serving a total of three years \u2014 and had lived in exile for almost five years. (A former inmate was quoted as saying that even in prison the ebullient Mr. Soares \u201cwas always in a splendid mood and made us laugh.\u201d) When he arrived by train in Lisbon from Paris after the revolt, he was mobbed by thousands of supporters.   He first served as foreign minister under the military-controlled civilian government and led the decolonization in Africa, ending years of war in Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique and other territories. But the government grew more radical under the influence of the Moscow-aligned Communist Party, prompting Mr. Soares to pull his party out of the coalition in 1975.   He organized street rallies and, with the help of a moderate military faction, ousted the pro-Communist prime minister, Vasco Gon\u00e7alves. Elections were called in 1976, and Mr. Soares won, making him the first constitutionally elected prime minister after the revolution.   \u201cWhat we believe in,\u201d he said after his victory, \u201cis a socialism in liberty, neither dictatorship of the left nor dictatorship of the right.\u201d   He served during a politically tumultuous period that saw coalitions form and dissolve. He was the head of two governments until 1979, and then of a third from 1983 to 1985.   In February 1986, Mr. Soares, a paunchy 61-year-old whom the right-wing opposition had called \u201cFat Cheeks,\u201d became the first democratically elected civilian president since 1926, ending 60 years of military oversight. He was re-elected in 1991 and left office in 1996. He ran again for president in 2006 but finished third.   Mr. Soares was an ardent bibliophile, amassing huge collections of books that he admittedly did not have time to read. He was also a lover of Portuguese cuisine, especially cod and fresh sardines.   It was during a stint in prison in 1949 that Mr. Soares married Maria Barroso, one of Portugal\u2019s leading actresses, whom he had met at the University of Lisbon. The prison wedding was a show of defiance that led to her being banned from the stage by the Salazar government.   In 1968, when Mr. Soares was banished to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Ms. Barroso, a founding member of her husband\u2019s Socialist Party, and their 15-year-old daughter, Isabel, joined about 100 supporters to see him off at Lisbon Airport and  were badly beaten  by the police. Ms. Barroso later founded a private school and was elected to the National Assembly before becoming first lady. She died in July 2015 at 90.   Mr. Soares was known for his quick-thinking debating skills and inspiring political oratory, though supporters, including former professors, and detractors alike said that dealing with practical details was not his strength. He preferred to focus on big ideas and grand plans.   He was also partial to the good life, owning a mountain house, a beach house and an apartment in Lisbon when he took office in 1986. At the time, he declined to move into Lisbon\u2019s lavish presidential palace.   But his heart was with the people, his admirers said \u2014 a portrayal he embraced immediately after his election to the presidency. With thousands of supporters chanting his name in the early morning, he strode to the balcony of a mansion he was using as his headquarters and, in victory, shouted, \u201cI am here to unite the Portuguese and not divide them!\u201d",

That, they say, would allow more time to vet the nominees. \u201cOur first overarching focus is getting tax returns and ethics forms,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota.   In a letter to Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the leader of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter M. Shaub Jr., said on Friday that \u201cthe announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me.\u201d   He said the packed schedule had put \u201cundue pressure\u201d on the office to rush its reviews of the nominees and he knew of no other occasion in the office\u2019s four decades when the Senate had held a confirmation hearing before the review was completed.   Mr. Schumer responded on Saturday by saying that the letter had made clear that the Trump transition team colluded with Senate Republicans to \u201cjam through\u201d the nominees. Several of the nominees are millionaires or billionaires and have vast webs of financial interests that must be untangled.   The Trump transition team issued a statement on Saturday evening defending its handling of the nomination process.   Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, said he thought none of the nominees could receive a full vote on the Senate floor before the vetting was complete. Norman Eisen, Mr. Obama\u2019s ethics counsel in his first term, said the paperwork delays were \u201ctotally unheard-of.\u201d   The status of the background checks and ethical clearances can change by the day. Republicans say they expect the missing documents to be submitted for all the nominees eventually.   The hearings are scheduled to begin on Tuesday, with testimony from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the nominee for attorney general, and Gen. John F. Kelly, the pick for homeland security secretary. On Wednesday, the parade of nominees is expected to include Rex W. Tillerson, the choice for secretary of state; Betsy DeVos, the pick for education secretary; and Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the nominee to lead the C.I.A. Later in the week, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chosen as commerce secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, the labor secretary pick, are scheduled to come before congressional panels.   While some of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees, notably Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the choice for health secretary and an ardent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, are certain to receive hostile receptions, large numbers of Democrats will probably vote for many others.   Still, Democrats are preparing a furious assault against the nominees by going after the president-elect himself and trying to drive a wedge between them over his most incendiary promises, like banning Muslim immigrants and bringing back torture.   \u201cWhere will they come down?\u201d Mr. Schumer, the new Democratic leader, asked in an interview. \u201cWill they try to persuade the president that\u2019s the wrong way to take America?\u201d   Democrats plan to keep the focus on the president-elect to a degree with few historical parallels. New presidents usually serve as a backdrop; this year, by contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s words will loom over the hearings as Democrats press the nominees to take a position on them.   Democrats have little chance of blocking any of the nominees, having given up the use of the  filibuster  in such cases when they were in the majority, but they say Mr. Trump has handed them ample political ammunition.   Mr. Sessions is certain to be asked whether he, as attorney general, would make good on Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to get a special counsel to \u201cjail\u201d Hillary Clinton over her email server.   General Kelly can expect questions about whether he favors Mr. Trump\u2019s call to build a wall on the Mexican border and create a database on Muslims.   Mr. Pompeo is likely to be asked about his views on Mr. Trump\u2019s support for waterboarding and his skepticism about the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings on Russian election meddling.   Mr. Tillerson will probably face a grilling over Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate accord.   Mr. Tillerson has spent hours trying to quietly assure lawmakers that he would take a more distant stance than Mr. Trump on the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, with whom Mr. Tillerson had close relations as the head of Exxon Mobil.   The Trump transition team, which did not comment on the background checks, is bracing its nominees for questions about the president-elect\u2019s more controversial positions, according to people with knowledge of the preparations. But officials would not say what tack the nominees would take in responding.   \u201cI have no doubt that the president-elect and a number of his comments will come up,\u201d said Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions\u2019s confirmation team. \u201cBut Senator Sessions has a long record of service himself.\u201d   Mr. Sessions will testify before the Judiciary Committee, which is generally friendly territory for sitting senators. But he is likely to face blistering questions from Democrats who are concerned about his civil rights record. In the 1980s, racially charged accusations derailed his nomination to a federal judgeship.   Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she would press Mr. Sessions to say where he stood on Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to have a special counsel further investigate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails.   \u201cHillary\u2019s situation is done, and other than some kind of gross retribution, there\u2019s no reason for that to even be something to look at,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said in an interview.   By posing tough questions, said Sarah A. Binder, a political scholar at George Washington University, Democrats will try to lure the nominees into inflicting political damage on themselves by adopting some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more divisive language. She said the terrain was so risky that the nominees might be better served by adopting a stance usually seen only from judicial nominees: \u201cDon\u2019t take a position.\u201d   Democrats intend to use all the procedural moves available to slow the process on the Senate floor, possibly spending up to 30 hours per nominee, denying Mr. Trump a full cabinet when he takes office.   Republicans are indignant. \u201cHolding up confirmations just for delay\u2019s sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. He added, \u201cThis is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay\u2019s sake President-elect Trump getting to fill his cabinet, particularly these important national security offices?\u201d",

   "7. content": "Organized labor suffered its first major legislative setback due to the 2016 elections on Saturday, when Kentucky Republicans gave final approval to right-to-work legislation and repealed the state\u2019s prevailing wage law. Both bills are expected to be signed into law by the governor, and will take effect immediately. Kentucky is the last holdout in the South without an anti-union right-to-work law on the books. For decades, labor unions and Democrats fended off such measures, which  diminish union membership and weaken the labor movement . But when Republicans captured the state House in November, they paved the way for passage of the legislation. The law  will apply to all new labor contracts, but will not affect current agreements. Unions and Democrats  mounted a last-ditch effort  to stop the legislation this week, holding protests at the state capitol building in Frankfort saying the bills would drive down wages. But Republicans now have overwhelming control of both the state Senate and the House. Kentucky\u2019s governor, Matt Bevin, is a Republican who won office in 2015. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting workers\u2019 pay,\u201d Bill Finn, state director of the Kentucky State Building and Construction Trades Council,  told The Huffington Post  this week. \u201cPeople voted for a change in this election, but they didn\u2019t vote for this. They didn\u2019t vote for pay cuts.\u201d \n Right-to-work laws forbid contracts that require all workers in a particular bargaining unit to pay fees to a union. Under  U.S. labor law , a union must represent all employees in a unionized workplace, even those who may not want representation. Unions argue it\u2019s only fair that all workers share the costs of bargaining and maintaining the union contract. By allowing individual workers to opt out of paying union fees while benefiting from representation \u2015 an arrangement unions call \u201cfree riding\u201d \u2015 right-to-work laws can drive down membership and weaken unions financially and politically. The conservatives who push right-to-work laws argue that they assure workers\u2019 individual freedoms by not compelling anyone to support a union. Labor leaders were equally troubled by the legislature\u2019s move to gut the state\u2019s prevailing wage law. Such laws require that employers pay certain minimum wages on work funded by public money. Backers of the laws say they help make sure companies accepting taxpayer dollars don\u2019t drive down wages and working conditions. Opponents argue they inflate the cost of public works projects. The repeal means prevailing wages will no longer apply to construction workers building schools and government buildings. Charlie Essex, the financial secretary for Local 369 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Louisville, called the measure \u201can attack on union people.\u201d He estimated that the prevailing wage law applied to more than 30 percent of union construction work in Kentucky. Backed by business lobbies, Republican lawmakers around the country have been aggressive in pushing right-to-work bills and prevailing wage repeals in recent years. When Democrats lose control of a statehouse chamber or the governor\u2019s mansion, they are often powerless to stop them. Long confined to the South and West, right-to-work proponents have recently made inroads elsewhere in the country, including even the industrial Midwest. Since 2012, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia have all gone right-to-work. Kentucky will be the 27th such state, making it  more the norm  than the exception around the country. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our  terms.

In a  message  posted on Twitter, Alexey Pushkov, a member of the defense and security committee of the upper house of the Russian Parliament, ridiculed the American report as akin to C.I.A. assertions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction: \u201cMountain gave birth to a mouse: all accusations against Russia are based on \u2018confidence\u2019 and assumptions. US was sure about Hussein possessing WMD in the same way.\u201d   Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, a state-funded television network that broadcasts in English, who is cited repeatedly in the report, posted her own  message  on Twitter scoffing at the American intelligence community\u2019s accusations.   \u201cAaa, the CIA report is out! Laughter of the year! Intro to my show from 6 years ago is the main evidence of Russia\u2019s influence at US elections. This is not a joke!\u201d she wrote.   Even Russians who have been critical of their government voiced dismay at the United States intelligence agencies\u2019 account of an elaborate Russian conspiracy unsupported by solid evidence.   Alexey Kovalev, a Russian journalist who has followed and frequently criticized RT, said he was aghast that the report had given so much attention to the television station. \u201cI do have a beef with RT and their chief,\u201d Mr. Kovalev  wrote  on Twitter , \u201cBut they are not your nemesis, America. Please chill.\u201d   The Kremlin, which has in the past repeatedly denied any role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer system, had no immediate response to the declassified report. Mr. Putin instead made a show of business as usual, attending a church service to mark the start of Orthodox Christmas.   The report provides no new evidence to support assertions that Moscow meddled covertly through hacking and other actions to boost the electoral chances of  Donald J. Trump  and undermine his rival, Hillary Clinton, but rests instead on what it describes as Moscow\u2019s long record of trying to influence America\u2019s political system.   \u201cRussia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on U.S. presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin,\u201d the report said. This campaign, it said, blended covert activities like hacking with public action by \u201cRussian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or \u2018trolls.\u2019 \u201d   The public report did not include evidence on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates that intelligence officials said was in a classified version.   Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence agencies at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said he was skeptical of the accusation that Mr. Putin had ordered the hacking. All the same, he added, Russian spies, like their Soviet predecessors, \u201cdon\u2019t just collect information but try to assert influence.\u201d United States intelligence operatives, he said, have often done the same thing but the Russians, convinced that the United States orchestrated protests in Ukraine in 2014 that toppled the pro-Moscow president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and other popular uprisings in former Soviet lands, \u201chave a more aggressive approach to meddling in other people\u2019s politics.\u201d   Particularly since Mr. Yanukovych lost power after protests in Maidan Square in Kiev, Mr. Galeotti said, Mr. Putin and his circle \u201chave a different sense of how the game is played. They genuinely believe that Maidan was engineered by the West\u201d and because of this \u201call bets are off\u201d in their view, a shift that has legitimized \u201cthe principle of regime change or at least regime disturbance\u201d through mischief making in the United States election.   That Russia considers it possible to influence United States elections has been evident since at least 1968 when, according to Moscow\u2019s former longtime ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, the Kremlin decided that Richard M. Nixon was \u201cprofoundly anti-Soviet\u201d and must be prevented if possible from winning the presidency. Mr. Dobrynin, in his 1995 memoir \u201cIn Confidence,\u201d said he was ordered by Moscow to offer Mr. Nixon\u2019s Democratic rival, Hubert H. Humphrey Jr., \u201cany conceivable help in his election campaign \u2014 including financial aid.\u201d   Mr. Dobrynin related in his memoir how he thought this was a bad idea but nonetheless made an oblique offer of help to Mr. Humphrey during a breakfast at the Democratic candidate\u2019s home. \u201cHe knew at once what was going on,\u201d Mr. Dobrynin recalled, and made it clear he had no interest in receiving any Soviet assistance.   To try to bring about change that suited Moscow\u2019s interests, the K.G.B. set up a special department dedicated to \u201cactive measures.\u201d This unit went beyond collecting intelligence and embraced measures aimed at changing the course of events around the world. These included disinformation and subversion, often involving various front organizations and Moscow-funded fringe parties that worked to shape the politics of foreign countries.   While propaganda and disinformation have long been key elements in efforts by both Moscow and Washington to shape events, the Kremlin, at least during the Cold War, went to extraordinary lengths to undermine foreign political figures it viewed as hostile to Soviet interests.   The K.G.B. fabricated a bogus F.B.I. report that Senator Henry M. Jackson, a strong critic of the Soviet Union who tried unsuccessfully in the 1970s to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, was a homosexual and attended gay sex clubs with Richard N. Perle, another anti-Communist hawk who was loathed by Moscow. Another target was President Carter\u2019s Polish-born national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski.   This tradition of maligning Moscow\u2019s foes on the United States political stage continued in the prelude to the November election with state-funded Russian media outlets, particularly the television network RT, which broadcasts in English, giving extensive coverage to negative news and allegations about Mrs. Clinton.   \u201cWhat we see now is a modernized version of the old tool kit of the U.S.S.R.,\u201d said Lorant Gyori, an analyst with Political Capital, a research group in Budapest that has studied Russian efforts to shape political events in Europe. He added that Russia\u2019s intelligence services, after a long lull following the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, had in recent years again switched from \u201cjust getting information to also getting influence.\u201d   Mark Kramer, an expert on the Cold War at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard, said the declassified report had erred by stating that the Russian \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d directed at the November election marked a \u201csignificant escalation\u201d of previous Russian operations. This assessment, he said, \u201cis simply untrue\u201d and reflects a lack of understanding of just how extensive Moscow\u2019s meddling has been in the past.   \u201cThe reality is that the two main Soviet intelligence and security agencies waged a vigorous campaign for decades to meddle in U.S. politics and discredit the United States,\u201d Mr. Kramer said in an email.   Mr. Galeotti, the intelligence expert in Prague, cautioned that this mission to influence foreign politics was not a uniquely Russian phenomenon but had also been embraced in the past by the C.I.A., which, in the 1950s, sought to shape and subvert politics in countries like Iran and Guatemala.   He said the United States intelligence report on Russian meddling in the November election had gone too far in projecting Cold War attitudes onto today\u2019s reality. He said it was a mistake to suppose that Mr. Putin had from the start conducted \u201ca Machiavellian conspiracy\u201d aimed at bringing Mr. Trump to power.   More likely, he added, was that Mr. Putin was not involved or even informed about initial efforts to hack into the D.N.C. computer system but, informed after the fact about what had been done, \u201cdecided to act opportunistically.\u201d   \u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians believed for a minute that Trump could really be elected,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey were convinced that U.S. elites would ensure that one of their own would win. They thought they had a chance to do a bit of mischief but I think they were amazed, even aghast, at what happened.\u201d",

The explosion occurred outside a local courthouse and security headquarters operated by the opposition fighters who control the town, Azaz, said Saif Alnajdi, a resident and activist.   \u201cIt hit the busiest part of the town,\u201d Mr. Alnajdi said, referring to its administrative section.   Azaz, a couple of miles away from the Turkish border, is a hub for antigovernment activists and opposition fighters, as well as many displaced people from the recent fighting in Aleppo. Activists say its prewar population of 30,000 has swelled.   The town is sandwiched between rival groups, including Kurdish fighters to the west and opposition groups backed by Turkey to the east. Militants of the Islamic State have been pushed back farther east by the Turkish-backed fighters.   No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The Islamic State has been accused of carrying out previous attacks there.   Rami Abdul Rahman, the founder of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, said the blast had been caused by explosives rigged to a tanker truck.   The activist-operated Azaz Media Center put the death toll at 60, adding that search-and-rescue operations had continued for hours after the explosion. The Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency said 53 wounded Syrians had been taken to a hospital in the nearby Turkish town of Kilis for treatment.   Mr. Alnajdi said rescue workers were still working to identify those who had been killed and ensure that bodies were removed from the area, suggesting that the death toll was likely to increase.   Many rebels and civilians who were pushed out of Aleppo during a government offensive late last year have resettled in Azaz.   Syrian Kurdish forces control territory to the west of Azaz. To the east, opposition fighters backed by Turkey have been pushing back the Islamic State, gaining territory and advancing on the town of Al Bab, a stronghold of the group, farther east.   A cease-fire has gone into effect across most of  Syria  since Russia and Turkey, who support opposite sides of the conflict, reached an agreement in late December.   Peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition in Kazakhstan are planned for this month. The Islamic State and a group with links to Al Qaeda are not included in the deal, the Syrian government has said.",

Rebellious soldiers from one battalion in the city erected barricades. Citizens in several cities reported that soldiers were patrolling the streets, some firing shots in the air. In Toulepleu, soldiers seized vehicles from citizens, said Serzh Kouehi, a resident there. Shots rang out throughout Friday in the cities of Korhogo and Bouak\u00e9. There were no immediate reports of casualties.   \u201cPeople are afraid because the soldiers all have weapons,\u201d said Estelle Koussi, a resident of Man, a city in western Ivory Coast, where the revolt also spread.   Early on Saturday, Alain Richard Donwahi, the country\u2019s defense minister, arrived in Bouak\u00e9, where the uprising appeared to have started, for talks with the rebellious soldiers, whose demands included raises, bonuses and shorter tenures of service.   After the deal was announced, local news media reports from Bouak\u00e9 said renegade soldiers were preventing Mr. Donwahi from leaving the city. But Mayor Nicolas Djibo of Bouak\u00e9 said late Saturday that the soldiers had never threatened Mr. Donwahi, and that the minister had traveled to the local airport after the talks.   The mutiny seemed to have taken Ivorian officials by surprise. Mr. Ouattara was in Ghana on Saturday for the inauguration of a new president there, but he returned to his country for an emergency meeting with his ministers. Mr. Djibo was away from Bouak\u00e9 on Friday and rushed home after the mutiny began.   Mamadou Koulibaly, an opposition party leader, criticized the government for not addressing the soldiers\u2019 complaints sooner.   \u201cWhat is this form of governance?\u201d he wrote   on Twitter . \u201cWhy wait for grievances to be made before addressing these problems if they are legitimate?\u201d   The Ivorian military has remained fractured as the government has struggled to integrate the rebels who helped install Mr. Ouattara in 2011 after his predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo, refused to accept an electoral defeat.   \u201cThe Ivorian Army for a long time now has been very volatile,\u201d said Rinaldo Depagne, the West Africa project director for the International Crisis Group. He said there was a huge gap in compensation between top- and lower-level officers.   A similar revolt occurred in November 2014, when thousands of Ivory Coast soldiers left their barracks to demand back pay and benefits. At the time, the government agreed to meet the demands of the former rebel fighters, but those grievances have lingered.   \u201cThe conditions in which these guys live are appalling,\u201d said Mr. Depagne, who visited military barracks around the time of the 2014 mutiny. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t match with the wealth of the country.\u201d   Julien Kouaho, an author who has written about Ivorian politics, said the rebellion needed to be resolved quickly or the nation\u2019s economy and political system would suffer. \u201cThe government must take this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military is not made to be in the streets, but in the barracks.\u201d   The actions of the rebels could have far-reaching consequences, Mr. Kouaho added.   \u201cThis is not a situation that can reassure investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population is terrified. It can be traumatized by these repeated crises and won\u2019t trust the rulers.\u201d",

As a federal employee, she just couldn\u2019t imagine sticking around and working for a man she worried would mistreat government workers and pursue dangerous, unethical policies. But she\u2019s not quite done with the president-elect yet. Diane is also a member of the National Guard and has been assigned to work at inauguration. \u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she sighed. \u201cHopefully we show our best for this inauguration, despite who is being inaugurated,\u201d she added. \u201cYou\u2019re no better than you are on your worst day, I guess I would say. We have a job to do, and I support our troops doing that job.\u201d \n Plenty of federal workers, service members and others who come to to participate in the festivities always have to take part in an inauguration for a president for whom they may not have voted. But this year seems a bit different. The 2016 campaign was particularly acrimonious, and Trump has had  trouble attracting entertainers  to perform at his big day. At least one D.C.-area marching band has participated in the past five inaugural parades, but  not a single one applied  for this year\u2019s. Federal employees or service members who have no choice but to be there are trying to make the best out of the uncomfortable situation. I don't think I'm going to have any patriotic emotions like the ones that I experienced during Obama's last inauguration. Member of a military band \n \n \n George* voted for Democratic presidential nominee  Hillary   Clinton , but because he plays in one of the military bands, he will also have to be at inauguration. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be different,\u201d he said, reflecting on the excitement and honor he felt performing in 2012 for President  Barack   Obama . \u201cMy first thought when the election results came out,\u201d he continued, \u201cwas, \u2018Should I look for new work? Am I going to be able to stomach this?\u2019\u201d \n He\u2019s since decided that he\u2019s not going to leave the band, but it\u2019s just not going to be the same as it was over the past four years. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a job,\u201d George added. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have any patriotic emotions like the ones that I experienced during Obama\u2019s last inauguration.\u201d \n For groups around the country who have decided to come to the nation\u2019s capital to participate in the civic event \u2015 which traditionally is an honor, remembered for a lifetime \u2015 there\u2019s considerable consternation for members about whether to join in. The  Rockettes  are one of the few big-name entertainment acts to agree to participate in Trump\u2019s inauguration, which has  upset many of its dancers . \u201c I wouldn\u2019 t feel comfortable  standing near a man like that in our costumes,\u201d one dancer wrote in an email to her colleagues, according to Marie Claire magazine. One Rockette told the magazine that participation appeared mandatory at first, but management made clear it was optional after some backlash from the performers. Nevertheless, many dancers worry that if they refuse to go, they\u2019ll face repercussions. A member of the  Mormon Tabernacle Choir , another group slated to perform at inauguration, has  resigned  from the group rather than sing for Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to tell myself that it will be all right and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man,\u201d wrote the member, Judy Chamberlin, in a Facebook post. \u201cI only know I could never \u2018throw roses to Hitler.\u2019 And I certainly could never sing for him.\u201d \n The Marist College marching band applied to perform at inauguration before it was clear who would win the election. When its application was accepted, the band director asked the members to privately let him know whether they wanted to march. A few people have decided to sit it out. One student who spoke with The Huffington Post said that although he doesn\u2019t like Trump, he\u2019s still going to march. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about him,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge honor to be playing at the inauguration, no matter who it was.\u201d \n The issue has been a hot topic at Marist, with an  online petition  from an alumna of the college asking the band to decline the inauguration invitation. \u201cI just hope that people don\u2019t end up turning on band members because of this,\u201d the member, who will be marching, told HuffPost. \u201cI just hope Marist doesn\u2019t become more divided by this, and that people end up respecting our side of things and hopefully kind of respecting our decision to march and us respecting the people who obviously decided not to march.\u201d \n  * Names have been changed at the request of the individuals over fears of retribution.

Putin .   President Obama  added to those measures  last month in retaliation for the hacking, expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on two Russian intelligence services. Russia and the United States have also often been at odds over Moscow\u2019s involvement in the war in Syria.   Senior intelligence  officials briefed Mr. Trump  on their findings on Russian election interference on Friday, before releasing  a declassified report  that concluded that Mr. Putin had \u201cordered\u201d a sprawling campaign intended to denigrate Hillary Clinton and aid Mr. Trump.   Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions as politically motivated, but he  appeared to soften that stance  in a statement his transition team released after the briefing. He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election, but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered, apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate.   Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the focus on Russian meddling in the election, arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss \u2014 an assertion  he repeated on Twitter on Saturday .   Late on Friday,  he blamed the Democratic National Committee  for the hacking of its computer systems, saying that \u201cgross negligence\u201d had allowed it to happen. Many Democrats  said  on Twitter  that Mr. Trump was essentially engaging in victim-blaming.",

For more than three decades, this was national policy in  China . The IUD was the government\u2019s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one.   Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in.   Now, a year after abandoning  the \u201cone-child\u201d policy , the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her \u2014 by removing their IUDs, free of charge. But the offer, made without even a hint of an apology, has provoked incredulous outrage.   \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even have had this in the first place, and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people,\u201d Ms. Lu, 36, scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the  eastern city of Linyi . \u201cIt\u2019s like they are slapping themselves in the face.\u201d   While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor\u2019s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all.   But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government\u2019s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child.   \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,\u201d said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades.   In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until  menopause ; while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer  birth control  for much longer.   China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and  health insurance . Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs.   From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their \u201ctubes tied.\u201d Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures \u2014 as well as abortions \u2014 be performed by force on women who resisted.   Then last year, confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force, President  Xi Jinping  relegated the one-child policy to the Communist Party\u2019s scrap heap of discarded dogma. And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake, the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with  reproducing .   To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child.   \u201cOur country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens\u2019 access to the free removal of IUDs,\u201d said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission\u2019s department of women and children.   But the head-spinning reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability \u2014 for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation.   The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to \u201cinvoluntary, forced acts of mutilation,\u201d Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3,000 times on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cAnd now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women \u2014 repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit \u2014 they have no shame, second to none.\u201d   Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD, which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization. In the novel \u201c Frog ,\u201d by Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the  Nobel Prize  in Literature, the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them.   In mainland China, being fitted with an IUD is called \u201cshang huan,\u201d a phrase that literally means \u201cinstalling a loop,\u201d referring to the low-cost,  stainless steel ring  that was the state\u2019s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of  complications . The rings were replaced in the mid-1990s by safer and more effective IUDs.   According to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out.   Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small.   Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model, there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD\u2019s impact on women\u2019s health. In 2012, the online portal Tencent published  a lengthy report  arguing that many Chinese women had \u201cexperienced serious damage to their mental and physical health\u201d from the IUD campaign because of \u201crough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions.\u201d   Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a  hysterectomy  when surgery to remove her IUD was botched.   \u201cIn the eyes of the government, women are labor units,\u201d Ms. Ai said. \u201cWhen the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don\u2019t need you to give birth, you don\u2019t.\u201d   Even before the end of the one-child policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang\u2019s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them.   But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the one-child policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale.   \u201cThey were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,\u201d he said.   The government\u2019s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation\u2019s  plummeting birthrate , now one of the lowest in the world. According to 2015 data, Chinese women had 1.05 children on average, well below the population replacement rate of more than 2.1.   With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China, scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis. But many couples are  not interested  in having a second child, some because of the potential costs, others because of their age.   Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a 9-year-old boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children.   \u201cI did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don\u2019t allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis national policy to have two children has come a bit too late.\u201d   Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies China\u2019s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older.   \u201cMost people have already lost the ability to give birth,\u201d Dr. Yi said by email. \u201cThe willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government\u2019s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate.\u201d   Mao Qun\u2019an, a spokesman for China\u2019s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.)   Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of \u201chaving it embedded in the uterine wall.\u201d \u201cThat makes it much more difficult to remove,\u201d Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus.   Asked about the public outcry over the government\u2019s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, \u201cWe did not deliberately emphasize that it\u2019s a government benefit.\u201d   Li Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government\u2019s approach, arguing that population control measures were \u201cnot targeted against women\u2019s rights.\u201d   \u201cIf the state doesn\u2019t engage in this, then it\u2019s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society.\u201d   But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to women is inhumane,\u201d said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. \u201cWhy did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman?\u201d",

Cooper said Friday he sent a letter to the Center for Medicaid Services this week requesting the expansion under the  Affordable Care Act , which Trump and Republicans in Washington, D.C., have pledged to repeal. The expansion extends Medicaid eligibility to people with incomes up to  138 percent below the federal poverty level . Under the ACA, the federal government would  pay for 95 percent of the cost of the expansion  and then a little less each year until paying 90 percent in 2020. In a  statement  Friday, Cooper noted that North Carolina hospitals pay $1 billion in care each year to residents who cannot pay and that expanding Medicaid was \u201ccommon sense.\u201d More than half a million North Carolinians could begin receiving healthcare in January next year if the plan goes through, Cooper said. \u201cWe can receive between $3 billion and $4 billion to pay for care that hospitals and other providers now give away,\u201d he said. That will create jobs, bolster our hospitals, could save some rural hospitals and work toward more stable private insurance premiums.\u201d  \n Cooper\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Pat McCrory (R)  signed a law in 2013  blocking the state from expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cunless directed to do so by the General Assembly.\u201d Republicans currently control both chambers of the North Carolina legislature. In his statement, Cooper claimed that the 2013 law did not prevent him from taking action. \u201cRight now, North Carolina tax dollars are going to Washington, where they are being redistributed to states that have expanded Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date, 31 states and Washington DC have expanded coverage through Medicaid; in 2016 these states received more than $70 billion in federal funds. Why should North Carolinians pay for Medicaid expansion in states like New Jersey, Ohio and Indiana when we don\u2019t even expand it to our own people?\u201d \n Phil Berger (R), the Republican leader in the state Senate, told the  News and Observer  that Cooper\u2019s actions would violate state law. \u201cJust days into his term as governor, Roy Cooper already intends to violate his oath of office with a brazenly illegal attempt to force a massive, budget-busting Obamacare expansion on North Carolina taxpayers,\u201d he said. \u201cCooper is three strikes and out on his attempt to break state law: he does not have the authority to unilaterally expand Obamacare, his administration cannot take steps to increase Medicaid eligibility and our Constitution does not allow him to spend billions of state tax dollars we don\u2019t have to expand Obamacare without legislative approval.\u201d \n Medicaid could be the latest in a series of confrontations between Cooper and Republicans in North Carolina. Just before he took office, Republicans  passed two laws  subjecting his cabinet picks to Senate confirmation and reducing his influence on election boards. A  three-judge panel  has blocked the latter law from taking effect while Cooper challenges it in court. Clarification:  Language has been amended to describe more accurately the new criteria under which one would qualify for Medicaid. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our  terms.

Proving that no target is too small for a Trump scorned, the president-elect helped oust the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party who had opposed his election and install an ally in a state where Republican officials were deeply split over Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.   One day after Mr. Trump took the extraordinary step of calling Ohio Republicans in an effort to defeat the sitting chairman, Matt Borges, a divided state party on Friday replaced him with Jane Timken, a Trump supporter and donor.   The fight effectively became a proxy battle between Mr. Trump and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who never endorsed Mr. Trump and supported Mr. Borges. The 66 voting members of the state Republican Party were almost evenly split between the candidates after two rounds of balloting. Then they decided to avert a third ballot by naming Ms. Timken chairwoman and creating a new post for Mr. Borges, \u201cchairman emeritus.\u201d   It was nonetheless a clear victory for Mr. Trump, who was able to overcome Mr. Kasich\u2019s determined lobbying of a group of activists in his own state, some of whom were hand-picked by the popular governor.   To do so, Mr. Trump had to take time from his presidential transition to pressure Ohio Republicans over the phone, a remarkable personal intervention in state party politics two weeks before he will take the oath of office.   For the president-elect, the motivation, as it often can be with him, was revenge. Mr. Borges was publicly critical of Mr. Trump for much of the campaign, and Mr. Kasich, a rival of Mr. Trump in the Republican primary, was one of his most prominent detractors throughout the election.   That Mr. Trump would take the time to oust a single state party chairman suggests that he may do much the same when anti-Trump Republicans who are actually in elected office face primaries in 2018. That, certainly, was the interpretation among Mr. Kasich\u2019s allies.   \u201cPetty grudge settling is a top priority for the next president and his henchmen,\u201d said John Weaver, an adviser to the governor. \u201cNot encouraging for those lonely souls still expecting Trump will ever try to unify.\u201d   Emerging from a 90-minute briefing with the nation\u2019s intelligence chiefs, Mr. Trump  issued a statement  acknowledging the hacking of \u201cthe cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee.\u201d But he said it had \u201cabsolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d   The intelligence chiefs showed Mr. Trump their evidence that Russia hacked into the accounts of political organizations and members of the Clinton campaign and that it made their correspondence public in an effort to influence the election. The president-elect was sharply questioning those findings as late as Friday morning.   The briefers included James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, who said on Thursday that he was \u201cmore resolute\u201d than ever in the conclusion that Russia was responsible for the hacking, and that it was part of a broader information warfare campaign. The director of the C.I.A., John O. Brennan; the head of the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command, Adm. Michael S. Rogers; and the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, also participated, officials said.   The meeting came at a moment of remarkable tension between the intelligence agencies and Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the conclusions about Russia and suggested that there was political motivation behind the intelligence findings. Mr. Clapper and Admiral Rogers said, somewhat diplomatically, at a Senate hearing on Thursday that while they welcomed skepticism, they believed that questioning the motives of the intelligence officials working on the issue was damaging to morale and to the agencies\u2019 ability to retain top talent.   An  unclassified version  of the report Mr. Trump heard about was made public Friday afternoon. The president-elect likely heard the most classified details, including information about the intercepts of conversation and computer traffic, and the human sources, that the intelligence agencies used to reach their conclusions.   A half-hour before he met with the nation\u2019s top intelligence leaders to hear their evidence that Russia interfered with the election, Mr. Trump demanded a congressional investigation of leaks from the intelligence report.   The post was a reference to an  NBC News report  that United States intelligence agencies heard senior Russian government officials cheering Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on election night. It was actually  first reported by The Washington Post .   Neither the president-elect nor Republican leaders in Congress have warmed to the idea of a special investigation into Russian efforts to swing the election to Mr. Trump. A leak investigation would swing the pressure the other way, toward bottling up evidence of Russian interference.   Before he sat down to learn how the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the National Security Agency and other agencies reached their conclusions, Mr. Trump continued on Friday to seethe about the report, condemning leaks of its findings, casting doubt on its conclusions and saying that Russia had nothing to do with his victory.   Hillary Clinton did beat him by nearly three million in the popular vote, but on Friday, Mr. Trump was  officially   declared the winner  of the Electoral College vote.   Mr. Trump appears to be worried about the turnout at his Jan. 20 inauguration as well.   A flurry of posts on Twitter on Thursday night captured Mr. Trump\u2019s mood:   Oh, to be a fly on the wall at Trump Tower as the president-elect learns more.   After  CNN reported Thursday night  that the incoming Trump administration would seek taxpayer funding for his promised border wall with Mexico, the president-elect took to Twitter on Friday morning to acknowledge that Mexico would not be paying for it \u2014 at least not at first.   And whom did he blame? The news media.   Making Mexico pay for the border wall was a central campaign promise and a common chant at his rallies.   Now, Mr. Trump is working with congressional leaders to find the money on this side of the border. The multibillion-dollar building effort would most likely use  authority approved in 2006 , when President George W. Bush signed legislation to construct a \u201cphysical barrier\u201d on the southern border.  Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team is already scouting locations  for the first legs of the \u201cGreat Wall.\u201d   And the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, says he told Mr. Trump during the campaign that his country had no intention of paying for it.   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee jumped on the issue immediately.   \u201cHouse Republicans and Donald Trump have wasted no time in breaking their promise to voters by preparing to waste massive amounts of American taxpayer money on an infeasible wall instead of focusing on rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating jobs and more effective approaches to improving our national security,\u201d said a spokesman, Tyler Law.   The incoming president wants the country to know that the man who succeeded him on his reality television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d is not doing so well. But hey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, supported Ms. Clinton, so what could we expect?   Mr. Trump has long been a ratings obsessive: He keeps photocopies of decade-old Nielsen charts and regularly called network executives at home to brag about \u201cApprentice\u201d numbers. He likes to remind television news producers about the big ratings he attracts and, as a candidate, asked voters, \u201cHow do you think Arnold\u2019s going to do?\u201d   Arnold did not do great. Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s debut on Monday attracted 4.9 million viewers, down from about 6.3 million for Mr. Trump\u2019s most recent season premiere. The president-elect remains a paid executive producer, but if his Friday posts on Twitter were meant as promotional, it\u2019s a funny way to go about it. A spokeswoman for Mark Burnett, who still runs the show, did not respond to a request for comment.   Mr. Schwarzenegger responded on Twitter by quoting Lincoln\u2019s appeal \u201cto our better angels.\u201d   With two weeks to go before his swearing-in, it seems Mr. Trump will not need to worry about having the money to pay for the lavish celebration that will accompany it.   The chairman of the inaugural planning committee, Thomas Barrack Jr., said on Friday that his finance team had raised $90 million to pay for the festivities, blowing past its own goal and the previous inaugural fund-raising record.   The total, raised over about six weeks, is close to double the $53 million that President Obama raised for his 2009 inauguration, the previous high-water mark. With large gifts from wealthy Republican donors forthcoming and a rash of corporate gifts, fund-raisers said they had little trouble surpassing their $70 million goal.   Mr. Trump had turned to a group of veteran Republican fund-raisers and close associates, like Mr. Barrack, to lead the effort.   The group was expected to wrap up its fund-raising efforts on Friday and turn its attention to finalizing the details of the parade, balls, rally and other events that will celebrate Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency.   The Obama administration on Friday denied nearly all outstanding permit requests from energy companies wishing to conduct seismic testing for  oil  and gas deposits off the Atlantic coast.   The announcement blocked planned seismic tests on large portions of waters from the coast of New Jersey to the Florida shore.   The process involves creating loud underwater blasts sent from ships. The blasts can help determine the location and size of oil and gas deposits, but environmentalists oppose the method because they say it disrupts the habitats and mating of fish and marine mammals.   The move is the latest in a series of efforts by the Obama administration to create new environmental protections before Mr. Obama leaves office.   Mr. Trump has vowed to open up America\u2019s federal lands and waters to new drilling, but Mr. Obama has used some novel moves to try to block or delay new offshore drilling. This month, he used an obscure provision in a 1953 law to permanently ban drilling in large portions of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. And experts say the move to deny seismic testing permits on such a large scale so late in an administration is also unusual.   Companies can reapply for the permits under the Trump administration, but the reapplication process, combined with a current Obama plan which bans all offshore Atlantic drilling until 2022, could significantly delay the expected start time of the testing.",

Sorry, but this isn\u2019t Rio de Janeiro.\u201d   Mr. Lima, 40, an acclaimed Brazilian rodeo announcer, has a point. Mud-splattered pickup trucks roam Goi\u00e2nia\u2019s streets. M\u00fasica sertaneja, Brazil\u2019s equivalent of country music, blares from speakers at open-air bars. Stores like  West Land ,  Texas Center  and  Botas Goyazes  sell western duds.   The growth of a cowboy culture here reflects major shifts in Brazil in recent decades. Buoyed by rising global  demand  for food, Brazil evolved into an  agricultural powerhouse , emerging as a top exporter of soybeans, corn, sugar and coffee.   Brazil also ranks among the world\u2019s largest beef producers, with a  cattle herd  that has grown more than 30 percent since 1990 to an estimated 215 million head. That gives Latin America\u2019s biggest country,  population  206 million, more cows than people.   While Brazil\u2019s economy is mired in a  long slump , agribusiness has remained largely  resilient  during the crisis. The expansion of a rodeo circuit in Brazil, with hundreds of flashy competitions held across the vast interior each year, points to the importance of ranching as a pillar of the economy.   That\u2019s where Mr. Lima comes in as an unofficial spokesman for Brazil\u2019s farm states.   While unknown to many residents of coastal cities in Brazil, he has won fame in the hinterland as a rodeo announcer with an ostentatious style that might shock some counterparts in the United States, and for his vocal embrace of socially conservative positions in a country  shifting to the right .   In a meandering interview over a lunch of draft beer and copious amounts of beef, Mr. Lima expressed his views on a wide variety of issues, including religion (he calls himself as a staunch Roman Catholic who also frequents an evangelical church), the role of women in society (his views appear to be reflected in a country music video he made in which he  boasts  about paying for a homemaker\u2019s plastic surgery) and the environment.   \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on the Amazon,\u201d Mr. Lima said, referring to the vast river basin where, the authorities say, the expansion of Brazil\u2019s ranching frontier has illegally destroyed large tracts of the rain forest. \u201cI\u2019ve flown over the Amazon in a small plane, and all I saw for hours was trees. Trust me, we can deforest a lot more if we have to.\u201d   Mr. Lima\u2019s readiness to voice publicly what many Brazilians say in private reflects, perhaps, a yearning for the spotlight. As he roams the backlands rodeo circuit in his Mitsubishi Titan pickup, the competitions where Mr. Lima works are often as much about him as they are about bull-riding buckaroos.   At a rodeo here in Goi\u00e2nia on a recent Friday night, scantily clad female dancers warmed up the arena before Mr. Lima burst onto the scene around midnight, his arrival heralded by fireworks, a nightclub smoke machine, cannons discharging confetti into the air and a dance involving a good deal of strutting by Mr. Lima himself.   After singing Brazil\u2019s national anthem, he led competitors in a lengthy prayer before getting on with the event. He often cracks jokes, exudes pride in Brazil\u2019s ranching culture and bursts into song while describing the technical aspects of the cowpokes competing for prize money.   \u201cI love the United States and recognize how much we owe to the rodeo scene up there, but the folks in Brazil expect a little more from their rodeo announcers,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat am I, essentially? A storyteller.\u201d   Mr. Lima got into radio announcing after studying three things: law, journalism and how to be a clown. He said it was during his time at clown school in Rio, when he was trying to find a way into show business, \u201cthat I learned the valuable lesson of laughing at my own failures.\u201d   A self-described \u201cbastard son of a rancher,\u201d Mr. Lima was raised by his mother, a shopkeeper, in Barretos, a city in S\u00e3o Paulo State that has long been an epicenter of the Brazilian rodeo scene. Mr. Lima travels extensively throughout the year to various farming regions, but still lives in Barretos with his wife and son.   To the surprise of some of his fans, he was not always Cuiabanno Lima. His given name was Andraus Ara\u00fajo de Lima; Andraus was also the name of a S\u00e3o Paulo skyscraper that  caught fire  in 1972, a tragedy in which people trying to escape the flames were filmed leaping to their death from upper floors.   \u201cObviously, I needed a new name, something that spoke to the greatness of the interior of Brazil,\u201d he said about his stage name. Cuiabanno refers to people from Cuiab\u00e1, the frontier capital of Mato Grosso, a western state with burgeoning farming enterprises.   In a country where animal-rights activists have grown more vocal in recent years, not everyone appreciates Mr. Lima\u2019s exaltation of Brazil\u2019s agribusiness prowess.   \u201cCuibanno is nothing more than an amusing court jester in a rodeo scene dominated by wealthy ranchers and corporate sponsors,\u201d said Leandro Ferro, president of I Hate Rodeo, a nonprofit group in S\u00e3o Paulo seeking to raise awareness about claims of animal cruelty at Brazil\u2019s rodeos.   Mr. Lima chafes at such criticism, contending that his critics are unrealistic about the significance of agriculture and ranching in contemporary society. \u201cNot everyone can go organic, eating leaves in expensive pretty packages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world needs animal protein, and Brazil supplies it.\u201d   As for rodeos, Mr. Lima said he was pleased that they were growing into a big business with corporate backers. He noted with pride that Brazilian \u201ccaub\u00f3is\u201d had grown so skilled in some competitions, like professional bull riding, that they ranked among the top   money earners  in the United States.   Despite championing such feats, along with his own rising prominence, Mr. Lima contends that elites in cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio opt to ignore the signs around them that Brazil\u2019s ranching culture, with its conservative values, is gaining prominence.   In Brazilian politics, for instance, a powerful bloc representing large landowners and large-scale agricultural interests exerts considerable sway in Congress. And a subgenre of Brazilian country music called \u201csertanejo universit\u00e1rio,\u201d tapping the aspirations of the college-educated middle class, has surged in popularity.   \u201cWe produce the country\u2019s wealth and increasingly the culture that people consume, but the interior of Brazil remains neglected,\u201d Mr. Lima said. \u201cSomething in this equation has got to give.\u201d",

   "7. content": "On the night of Nov. 16, a group of executives gathered in a private dining room of the restaurant La Chine at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The table was laden with Chinese delicacies and $2,100 bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild. At one end sat Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of the Waldorf\u2019s owner, Anbang Insurance Group, a  Chinese financial behemoth  with estimated assets of $285 billion and an  ownership structure shrouded in mystery . Close by sat Jared Kushner, a major New York real estate investor whose father-in-law, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States.   It was a mutually auspicious moment.   Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner \u2014 who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers \u2014 were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan: the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family real-estate empire. Anbang, which has close ties to the Chinese state, has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk.   Now, according to two people with knowledge of the get-together, Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared his desire to meet the president-elect, whose ascension, he was sure, would be good for global business.   Since the election, intense scrutiny has been trained on Mr. Trump\u2019s company and the  potential conflicts of interest  he will face. But with Mr. Kushner laying the groundwork for his own White House role, the meeting at the Waldorf shines a light on his family\u2019s multibillion-dollar business, Kushner Companies, and on the ethical thicket he would have to navigate while advising his father-in-law on policy that could affect his bottom line.   Unlike the  Trump Organization , which has shifted its focus from acquisition to branding of the Trump name, the Kushner family business, led by Mr. Kushner, is a major real estate investor across the New York area and beyond. The company has participated in roughly $7 billion in acquisitions in the last decade, many of them backed by opaque foreign money, as well as financial institutions Mr. Kushner\u2019s father-in-law will soon have a hand in regulating.   The Anbang talks, which have not previously been reported, began roughly six months ago \u2014 \u201cWell before the president-elect\u2019s victory,\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokeswoman, Risa Heller, noted. That was, however, just as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the talks are far along, representatives for Mr. Kushner said some points remained unresolved. Ms. Heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion.   Mr. Kushner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has hired a leading Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to advise him on how to comply with federal ethics laws should he join the White House staff as an adviser to the president. The firm has concluded that one potential sticking point, a federal anti-nepotism law, is not applicable, though not all ethics experts agree. While the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead, Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyers argue, among other things, that the White House is not an agency and is therefore exempt.   As for conflicts of interest, Mr. Kushner would be required to make limited financial disclosures, which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings. And, unlike Mr. Trump, who as president will be exempt from conflict-of-interest laws, he would have to recuse himself from decisions with a \u201cdirect and predictable effect\u201d on his financial interests.   Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said.   He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue.   Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own.   Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law.   Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a b\u00eate noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm\u2019s president,  Gary D. Cohn , as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company co-founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother.   Mr. Trump has said that his son-in-law, an Orthodox Jew, will  play a central role in dealings with Israel , describing him as so talented that he could help \u201cdo peace in the Middle East.\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s company has received multiple loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a  Justice Department  investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes.   Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement.   So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China\u2019s \u201cdeep displeasure\u201d at Mr. Trump\u2019s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by  speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan , the White House did not call the president-elect\u2019s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors.   Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions.   Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201d   Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201d   Like the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father.   In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New Jersey-based construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming  a leading Democratic donor , contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and  winning appointment to the board  of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.   But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business\u2019s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was  sentenced to two years in prison  for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister.   Jared, 23 at the time of his father\u2019s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate.   It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before.   Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier.   Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. \u201cJ-Vanka,\u201d  the headlines blared , as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven.   Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men.   In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit.   In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle.   Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.   Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia.   Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.   As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently  reached a $7.2 billion settlement  with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore.   Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces.   He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a  venture capital  firm  valued at about $1.5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is  Oscar , a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar\u2019s investors have included Li Ka-shing, who is one of Hong Kong\u2019s richest men, and China\u2019s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China.   The Kushner brothers have counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, as investors in another endeavor \u2014  Cadre , a tech-savvy real estate investment company they started with a friend. Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures.   But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies.   One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified.   The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants two-year visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500,000. The program, known as EB-5, has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing; in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9,764 of the visas \u2014  overwhelmingly to applicants from China .   But the program, which must be renewed periodically by Congress, has lately  come under fire . The Government Accountability Office has  issued several reports  raising concerns about what it termed the program\u2019s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial  ties to a string of Chinese brothels .   Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China.   In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet.   But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant.   Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington.   The Times reported last year  that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People\u2019s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board.   Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines.   Anbang\u2019s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he  decided to seek other accommodations . American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time; a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns.   National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States.   One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection.   Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain,  outbidding Marriott with a $14 billion offer . It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately  Anbang walked away from the deal  before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail.   And while Anbang\u2019s planned $1.57 billion purchase of Des Moines-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it  stalled  after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang\u2019s shareholding structure.   But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment.   Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment.   It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while.   By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get.   Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments.   Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria.   Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say.   It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that  benefited donors to her family\u2019s charitable foundation  while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium-extraction capacity.   On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.   With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated.   \u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present.",

And women were charged more than men for the same health insurance plans because they tend to have babies, visit the doctor more often and live longer. The Obama administration was the first to treat women\u2019s preventative health care, including birth control, as a necessity instead of a luxury. The Affordable Care Act banned insurance companies from the practice of \u201cgender rating\u201d and required all insurance plans to cover the full range of contraception methods and well-woman visits, without a co-pay. \u201cIt has really revolutionized how the health care system deals with reproductive health care, particularly family planning,\u201d Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, told The Huffington Post. \u201cWomen now expect that birth control is a part of regular health care. We had to fight to get that done, but it\u2019s been a sea change.\u201d  \n Obama\u2019s signature health care law  saved women $1.4 billion on birth control pills alone  in 2013, the year after it went into effect. More than 55 million women now get their contraception and well-woman visits for free, and unintended pregnancy in the United States is  at a 30-year low . But those benefits may be short-lived, as Republicans are threatening to repeal Obamacare once President-elect  Donald Trump  takes office. Richards said Planned Parenthood had a \u201cflood of women\u201d calling in the days after Trump was elected, trying to get intrauterine devices and other long-term forms of birth control while their insurance is still required to cover them. \u201cWe had historic numbers of people calling, because women understood this is a benefit they got under Obama that\u2019s now at risk,\u201d Richards said. This piece is part of a series on Obama\u2019s legacy that The Huffington Post will be publishing over the next week. Read  other pieces in the series here . Even if they decide to keep some aspects of Obamacare, the incoming  Trump administration  and Republican-controlled Congress will probably not be friendly to the birth control access provisions. Republicans see the birth control coverage rule as an affront to religious freedom, arguing that employers who morally oppose birth control shouldn\u2019t have to provide it in their health plans. And Trump\u2019s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), said in 2012 that birth control does not need to be covered because women have never had trouble paying for it. \u201cBring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There\u2019s not one,\u201d Price  said at the time . \u201cThe fact of the matter is this is a trampling on religious freedom and religious liberty in this country.\u201d   \n \n It\u2019s a real risk for this new administration to try to take women back to the 1950s \u2015 particularly young women who have grown up under this administration. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood \n \n \n Republicans have also repeatedly tried to defund Planned Parenthood, the largest family planning provider in the country, because of some of its clinics provide abortions. Planned Parenthood receives about $70 million a year in Title X federal family planning funds to provide birth control, cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing to low-income patients. But nearly half the states in the country have attempted to withhold money from Planned Parenthood, and Republicans in Congress  plan to spend $1.6 million  in taxpayer dollars this year to investigate the family planning provider. Senate Democrats are prepared to battle for Planned Parenthood funding and the birth control benefit under the new administration. \u201cIt would be truly appalling and a grave mistake for Republicans in Congress and the incoming administration to attempt to force women to pay more for the preventative health care they need,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \u201cIf they do try, they should know that I, together with millions of women across the country, will be ready to fight back as hard as we can against any attempt to roll back women\u2019s health care and to protect the progress we\u2019ve made.\u201d \n The Obama administration  issued a rule in December  that prevents states from defunding Planned Parenthood for political reasons. But that rule probably won\u2019t last under Trump. Still, Republicans may find that it\u2019s much more difficult to take away access to preventative care now that women have now come to expect it. Even if they repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood, eliminate birth control coverage and roll back abortion rights, Obama has already shown women what equitable health care feels like and has motivated a new generation of women to fight for it. \u201cIt\u2019s a real risk for this new administration to try to take women back to the 1950s \u2015 particularly young women who have grown up under this administration,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt\u2019s like lighting a match and dropping it on dry tinder.\u201d  \ntype=type=RelatedArticlesblockTitle=Related coverage... + articlesList=586d1824e4b0de3a08fa54fc,584eea35e4b04c8e2bb0cee2,586bfbfbe4b0d9a5945cc204  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our  terms.

Left unsaid, though, was that the overwhelming dominance of American female athletes in international competitions during Obama\u2019s two terms represented  a major public policy victory  for the United States, which more than four decades earlier had enshrined equal opportunity for girls and women in sports into federal law. Obama is not responsible for creating Title IX, the 1972 law meant to guarantee women and girls equal access to athletics and education. But the president has  aggressively celebrated, enforced and expanded  Title IX\u2019s reach on issues from gender equity in sports to campus sexual assault to the rights of transgender students and athletes. Now, as President-elect  Donald Trump  sets out to reshape federal education policy, the question is whether that legacy can remain intact. A Reversal Of Bush-Era Policy \n Although Title IX itself does not explicitly mention sports, it is most commonly associated with gender equality on the athletic field. And almost immediately after Obama took office, his administration set about reshaping how the law applied to female athletes. In 2005, President George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Education walked back decades of Title IX practices by changing the rules for how to determine whether schools had violated female students\u2019 rights to equal opportunity. The Bush administration\u2019s move was seen as a setback for women and girls, who still faced massive gaps in access to sports at the primary and secondary school level. Activists pressured Obama and then-Education Secretary Arne Duncan to take action. The Education Department reversed the Bush administration\u2019s guidance in 2010,  reinstating earlier standards  that increased the burden on schools to demonstrate their compliance with the law. Complaints under Title IX drastically increased in the following years: In the 2013-14 fiscal year, the department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights received  more than 3,600 official complaints  alleging disparities in athletic opportunities \u2014 nearly triple the number that had been filed in the four years prior. Activists at the time said  the  rise in complaints were due at least in part  to increased awareness about the law and the growing expectation that women and girls deserve equal footing on the field. A \u2018Historic\u2019 Move Against Campus Sexual Assault \n A year later, an even bigger change \u2014 one that could become the defining legacy of how Obama and Vice President  Joe Biden  approached Title IX \u2014 arrived when the administration took on an issue activists and students had pressed them on for years: campus sexual assault. Federal officials had previously released recommendations on how to handle sexual assault and violence complaints under Title IX. But in 2011, the Office of Civil Rights issued what\u2019s called a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d  letter  \u2014 a means of outlining procedures and official departmental guidance under the law  \u2014 that told school administrators at the collegiate and K-12 level that they were responsible for protecting women from sexual violence and outlined specific rules and procedures for how to handle claims of assault. \u201cThis was historic,\u201d said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president who spearheaded much of the administration\u2019s gender equity policy moves. \u201cWhile Title IX had always protected students from sexual harassment and assault, this was the first time any federal administration called sexual violence a civil rights issue.\u201d \n That change  has had tangible effects,  especially when coupled with awareness campaigns Biden and student activists  launched in subsequent years : The Office of Civil Rights is currently investigating more than 400 sexual assault complaints at colleges and schools, Jarrett said. Those include complaints at  some of America\u2019s most prestigious universities  \u2014 including Harvard, Yale and Stanford \u2014 and in school districts in some of its largest cities,  including the nation\u2019s capital . Several of the most high-profile cases involving Title IX and sexual assault came  from the world of college sports . None, perhaps, made bigger news than the case of former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, who was accused of rape by a female student in 2012. Winston wasn\u2019t charged \u2014  Florida State  settled a Title IX lawsuit  with the accuser in January 2016, and Winston  and his accuser ultimately  settled lawsuits  against each other in December . But his case became a national example of the myriad issues around sexual assault on college campuses. It had the effect of broadening the impact of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to change the way such cases are handled, said Scott Lewis, a partner at the NCHERM Group, which advises schools on Title IX compliance. \u201cThe Winston case, I think, took it to the broader audience in a fashion that had not been introduced to them before,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThat broadened the audience. Now you had ESPN talking about it in a different way [as well as]   other people who before weren\u2019t as open to that concept having more discussions about how schools should be doing this.\u201d \n \n \u2018Concern\u2019 For The Trump Era \n The Obama administration took another major action on Title IX in May, when the Education and Justice departments reminded schools that the law  guaranteed equal treatment for transgender students  \u2014 something that will inevitably spill over into athletics, given the controversy over the ability of those students to access the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. However, activists and experts are worried that the  Trump administration  could roll back Obama\u2019s expansive actions. Conservatives have already opposed the inclusion of transgender students under Title IX. The issue could soon be decided in court, after a federal judge  granted a preliminary injunction  requested by Texas and other states. There have also been concerns \u2015 including from  universities  and  legal scholars \u2015 that the Obama administration  applied Title IX  to campus sexual assault and harassment issues in ways that hurt due process rights of accused students or lead to overzealous investigations. Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Education, supports  major reforms for public education . And although  her past suggests  she will oppose the Obama administration\u2019s inclusion of transgender students in Title IX, she has said little about her approach. There\u2019s a lot of understandable anxiety based on statements by the campaign and nominations that have been announced. Neena Chaudhry, director of education at the National Women's Law Center \n \n \n \u201cObviously we\u2019re concerned there will be a rollback in enforcement,\u201d said Neena Chaudhry, director of education and senior counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of understandable anxiety based on statements by the campaign and nominations that have been announced,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen an uptick in harassment and violence even since November, and I think it will be very important for the incoming administration to ... continue to vigorously enforce civil rights law.\u201d \n But Chaudhry and others also see reasons to believe that big, swift changes might not come \u2014 especially when it comes to addressing campus sexual assault. There\u2019s bipartisan support for Senate legislation that  could force sweeping changes  in how colleges handle sexual assault cases. And schools have begun to take action on their own. Florida State, for example, argued that it  undertook major efforts to reshape its approach to sexual assault cases  in the wake of the Winston case, and Lewis said the rash of investigations and complaints over the last five years have begun to shift attitudes on campuses across the country. Schools now believe they have the responsibility to address these issues, and those attitudes won\u2019t be easy to change. At least on sexual assault issues, the Obama administration\u2019s Title IX legacy is \u201cpretty well-established in the fact that schools are really changing the way they address these issues, arguably in a fashion that should have been changed years ago,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere\u2019s an increase in reporting of incidents, an increase in adjudication, and an increase in accountability. I think their legacy is that schools are starting to realize that they have to do this better.\u201d \n \n There is similar momentum in sports. During the Obama years, women have ascended to previously inaccessible roles and set milestones in the Olympics,  Major League Baseball ,  the NFL , the  NBA  and the  sports media . When the USWNT visited the White House, a 13-year-old girl named Ayla Ludlow introduced the president. That summer, Ayla\u2019s brother had walked into the room where she was watching the Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cAyla,\u201d she says he said, \u201cboys are so much better than girls at soccer.\u201d \n \u201cIt makes me mad that people do not treat girls equally,\u201d Ayla wrote in a letter to the Obamas. \u201cPlus,\u201d she wrote, \u201ca lot of girls are better at sports than boys.\u201d \n \n This piece is part of a series on Obama\u2019s legacy that The Huffington Post will be publishing over the next week.

The subject was Obamacare, which Republicans consider one of history\u2019s great disasters, and their effort to repeal it quickly now that Donald Trump is about to become president. More than 20 million people rely on the Affordable Care Act for health coverage. Repeal would leave most of them without insurance, unless a replacement is ready to go, and GOP leaders are nowhere close to creating one. When a reporter asked Ryan about this on Wednesday, he reiterated a promise he and his allies have made before \u2015 that Republicans would keep some of Obamacare\u2019s elements in place, for a year or two or maybe longer, so that beneficiaries remain insured until Republicans can introduce a new system. But Ryan\u2019s phrasing this time was unintentionally revealing. He said, \u201cWe want to make sure there is an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief.\u201d \n It\u2019s a long, disjointed sentence because Ryan is trying to hit a bunch of different talking points. That\u2019s what politicians do. But in this case, two of his arguments actually contradict one another. With one breath, he\u2019s saying that the people who have Obamacare insurance are \u201cstruggling.\u201d With another, he\u2019s saying that taking away their coverage would be like pulling a rug from under them. Both things can\u2019t be true. If Obamacare is as awful as Ryan says, then the people who stand to lose its insurance shouldn\u2019t mind at all. But many of them would clearly be upset. That makes repeal a lot more difficult \u2015 and it\u2019s why Republicans face such a quandary now. There\u2019s no question that millions of people don\u2019t like how Obamacare has worked out for them. They are paying higher premiums, facing higher out-of-pocket costs, or dealing with more limited networks of providers, just as Ryan and the Republicans say. The reason is that Obamacare rewrote the rules for selling insurance directly to individuals. Now, carriers must cover everybody, no matter how sick or old, and their policies must include a wide array of benefits \u2015 including things like rehabilitative care, mental health, and maternity. In effect, young and healthy people lost the preferential pricing they used to get \u2015 and they can no longer find bare-bones policies that were available before. If Republicans scale back Obamacare\u2019s requirements, or get rid of them altogether, many of the people paying more now will go back to paying less. But there\u2019s another group who clearly benefit from the new rules. It includes older and sicker people whom insurers traditionally turned down or who, at the very least, needed the full of array of medical services that policies frequently didn\u2019t cover in the old days. And then there are the millions who benefit from Obamacare\u2019s tax credits to reduce their premiums, or who qualify for Medicaid in states that have expanded eligibility. Previously, many of these would have been uninsured. Are all of these people thrilled with their coverage? No. But in surveys, Obamacare users tend to give the insurance  decent  or even  high  marks, depending on the focus and wording of the questions. And it\u2019s safe to assume most of the newly insured would prefer Obamacare coverage to what they\u2019d get under (still mostly hypothetical) Republican alternatives, since the aggregate effect of GOP plans would be to provide less financial assistance, not more, and to leave people with serious health problems exposed to bigger medical bills. Repealing Obamacare would create losers as well as winners, just like creating Obamacare did. As long as repeal was a talking point and not a realistic possibility, Republicans could ignore that possibility. Now they can\u2019t. They don\u2019t know what to do. This is why some Republicans on Capitol Hill are  sounding   nervous  \u2015 and why Ryan suddenly isn\u2019t making sense. Want more updates on policy & politics from Jonathan Cohn?

   "7. content": "The gunman  who opened fire Friday  in a deadly attack at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., pulled his weapon out from an unlikely place in this post-9/11 era of tightened  airport security  and pat-downs by the  Transportation Security Administration  \u2014 his checked luggage.

According to the T.S.A., passengers at the nation\u2019s airports are allowed to transport unloaded guns in their checked baggage. The firearms must be kept in a locked \u201chard-sided\u201d container, and gun owners must declare firearms and any ammunition to airline representatives when checking the bags at ticket counters, according to  the agency\u2019s  firearm regulations . Guns, real ones as well as replicas and toys, are allowed to be transported only in checked baggage, not in carry-on luggage. The same is true for clips, firing pins and other firearm parts.   The shooting has shed light on a rather obscure aspect of American air travel. Airport security experts said the practice has not been a cause of concern for law enforcement officials, and gun-rights advocates defended it as safe and said Mr. Santiago\u2019s actions did not represent the majority of gun owners who travel with their weapons.   Gun-control supporters said the shooting raised questions about the efforts in some states, including Florida, to allow gun owners to carry firearms inside passenger terminals in airports, but it was unclear if the shooting would lead to calls for the T.S.A. to tighten firearm regulations.   Kevin Murphy, the executive director of the Airport Law Enforcement Agencies Network, a nonprofit group that represents law enforcement agencies that protect airports, said the practice of transporting weapons in checked bags had become routine.   \u201cFederal regulations allow the carriage of firearms in checked baggage,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, the former police chief of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \u201cSince there are so many states that allow the concealed and open carry of firearms in the nonsecure side of airport terminals, the carriage of firearms in checked baggage poses the same level of risk as any public building in which carrying firearms is allowed.\u201d   Jerry Patterson, a former Texas land commissioner and a gun-rights supporter who wrote the state\u2019s concealed-carry law, said he had carried shotguns, rifles and handguns in checked bags for years when traveling.   \u201cI carry a gun in checked baggage every time I fly,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cLately, it\u2019s become very routine at the airline counter and very professional by T.S.A. and airline staff. What would I tell a person surprised about carrying a firearm in a checked bag? I would ask them if they\u2019d rather I\u2019d keep it in my carry-on bag.\u201d   It was unclear if Mr. Santiago, who was arrested, was allowed to carry a handgun in Florida and if the gun was bought legally. The motive for the shooting remained unclear, though federal law enforcement officials said Friday that Mr. Santiago might have been mentally disturbed.   In many cases, air travelers are not required to show any registration or paperwork for the firearm. The declaration required by the T.S.A. often amounts to travelers\u2019 signing a tag or document declaring that the firearm is not loaded.   The shooting occurred just four weeks after a Republican lawmaker in Florida filed a bill to expand gun rights in the state by allowing people with concealed-carry permits to carry their firearms inside airport passenger terminals and in other areas, including college campuses. Current state law allows guns inside passenger terminals, but only if the guns are inside locked cases for checked baggage. The bill would still prohibit the carrying of guns through security screening.   The lawmaker, State Senator W. Gregory Steube, and gun-rights proponents said the bill was a public-safety measure meant to increase the number of places where law-abiding gun owners could carry their firearms. Gun-control advocates appeared ready to use the shooting in their efforts to defeat that bill and others like it in the Florida Legislature.   \u201cFloridians have the right to be in an airport, a nightclub or on college campuses without the fear of possibly being gunned down,\u201d said Michelle Gajda, a leader of the Florida chapter of  Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America , adding, \u201cToday should serve as a reminder that guns have no place in such areas in our communities.\u201d   Federal laws allowing guns to be checked at airport counters have sometimes caused confusion among gun owners traveling to cities with strict firearms regulations. A number of visitors to New York City  have been arrested  at its airports upon checking their guns for their return flights home, unaware that they have broken the law by possessing guns in the city without a city gun permit. (Most end up paying a fine.)   Various airlines have different limits on the carrying of firearms in checked bags. United Airlines, for example, accepts guns only from travelers who are 18 or older and permits ammunition to be packed in the same container as the firearm or a separate one, but no more than 11 pounds of ammunition are allowed. On United flights, the firearm is transported in a section of the aircraft that is inaccessible to the passenger.",

Ms. Mugabe \u2014 known mostly for her lavish overseas shopping trips until she entered politics just two years ago \u2014 has emerged as one of the main actors in the fierce maneuvering to succeed Mr. Mugabe that has engulfed Zimbabwe in the last year, as the president\u2019s visible decline presages the end of an era.   She is, to many people, the real power behind the throne, vowing to keep her husband in office until his death while she consolidates her support. She told supporters recently that she was \u201c already the president ,\u201d planning and doing everything with her husband.   The signs of Ms. Mugabe\u2019s growing stature are unmistakable. On stage at the party congress, she sat closest to her husband, who, a couple of months shy of 93 years old, dozed through most speeches. Party leaders invariably praised her also \u2014 \u201cForward with President Mugabe! Forward with Dr. Amai Grace Mugabe!\u201d \u2014 before others officially higher in the party hierarchy. A choir that usually sings the president\u2019s praises composed a song for the first lady for the first time.1   \u201cBe pleased to follow Mrs. Mugabe, a mother who has love, mother of the nation, the one who takes care of orphans,\u201d the Mbare Chimurenga Choir sings in its new song, \u201cFollowing Mother Mugabe.\u201d   Though visibly asleep during most of the congress, Mr. Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state and the only leader Zimbabwe has known since its independence in 1980, was selected as his party\u2019s candidate in the 2018 presidential election. He would be 94 by then and, should he win, 99 by the end of his term.   At the congress, Mr. Mugabe appeared increasingly dependent on his wife, who is 51. When a waiter carrying bags of potato chips on a silver tray startled Mr. Mugabe, the first lady chose a bag, from which the president then slowly picked out one single chip after another. At a  tree-planting ceremony , a seemingly confused president kept tapping a mound of dirt with his shovel until the first lady intervened \u2014 \u201choney,\u201d she called him \u2014 by grabbing the shovel herself.   Whether the first lady\u2019s power will survive her husband\u2019s death is unclear. She is reported to head one of the two competing factions inside ZANU-PF, but is she its leader, or just a useful puppet for veteran survivors of Zimbabwean politics? After her husband dies, will she hop on a plane for Dubai or elsewhere in Asia, where she and her children have established homes? The Mugabes are thought to have more than  $1 billion invested outside Zimbabwe , according to an American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks.   But if she succeeds in grabbing power, it would most likely be a continuation of her husband\u2019s government. Changes critical to reviving Zimbabwe\u2019s crumpled economy, including land reform, are thought politically impossible under Mr. Mugabe and would remain so under Ms. Mugabe, whose legitimacy derives from her husband\u2019s legacy. Her elevation could also intensify tensions in Zimbabwe\u2019s small political class by upsetting Mr. Mugabe\u2019s lieutenants, many of whom have been waiting decades to take over.   Confident of their grip on power, the Mugabes flew out of Zimbabwe a few days after the end of the congress in mid-December for their annual extended holiday in Asia, where Mr. Mugabe is thought to have received medical care in Singapore and Malaysia, and where the first family owns real estate in Hong Kong.   Ms. Mugabe left for her latest holiday even though she was embroiled in a dispute with a Lebanese diamond dealer over a $1.35 million ring. According to a court document, Ms. Mugabe ordered the diamond from the dealer; issued the payment from a bank in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital; then canceled her purchase after the diamond had already been prepared. Ms. Mugabe demanded that the dealer refund the money to a bank account in Dubai, according to the court document.   The dealer, Jamal Ahmed, said he had refused to transfer the money to Dubai because it would be considered money laundering, but agreed to reimburse the first lady in installments, according to an affidavit submitted to the High Court of Zimbabwe. Men associated with Ms. Mugabe and her son from a previous marriage subsequently seized and occupied three of the dealer\u2019s properties in Harare.   Wilson Manase, Ms. Mugabe\u2019s lawyer, did not return calls and messages to his cellphone.   Ms. Mugabe had picked the diamond as her husband\u2019s 20th wedding anniversary present to her.   The president and Ms. Mugabe became involved when she worked as a typist in the president\u2019s secretarial pool. The president\u2019s first wife \u2014 Sally, a much-loved figure in Zimbabwe although she was from Ghana \u2014 was terminally ill at the time and approved of the affair, Mr. Mugabe has said in the past.   To some who have long known Mr. Mugabe, the marriage to Grace changed the president\u2019s priorities.   \u201cMugabe did change automatically \u2014 it was so dramatic,\u201d said Margaret Dongo, a former ZANU-PF official now in the opposition, adding that Mr. Mugabe had never shown interest in money before his second marriage. \u201cBut Grace knew that it was the time to make money. Whatever she did, she made sure she benefited more out of it.\u201d   Ms. Mugabe has run a large dairy business from a farm she owns and seized former white-owned farms from top ZANU-PF officials for her own family. According to American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, Ms. Mugabe was engaged in the  illegal mining of diamonds  in eastern Zimbabwe. She was also involved in many commercial and residential construction projects, choosing to contract  South Korean construction firms .   In 2007, in an  assessment of Ms. Mugabe , the political officer in the American Embassy in Harare wrote that \u201cGrace\u2019s primary personal interest appears to be shopping.\u201d   \u201cWe believe Grace has little or no political influence over her husband,\u201d the officer wrote.   But two years later, Gunnar Foreland, a  Norwegian ambassador  with experience in Africa, warned his American counterpart about underestimating Ms. Mugabe\u2019s influence over her husband. \u201cShe acts as a kind of gatekeeper, often controlling who sees him, and what information gets to him,\u201d the ambassador said.   Ms. Mugabe formally entered politics in 2014, becoming leader of ZANU-PF\u2019s women\u2019s league. She was awarded a doctorate after only two months at the University of Zimbabwe. Supporters have engaged in the kind of mythmaking that had been reserved for the president, who is often described as walking on water and in other Christlike terms.   Namatirai Chivhanga, a top women\u2019s league official, said the first lady\u2019s loving embrace of the country\u2019s orphans was so moving that one couldn\u2019t help crying.   \u201cSomehow she\u2019s putting on Pampers and all the children are calling her Mama, Mama,\u201d Ms. Chivhanga, a delegate to the congress, said, adding that she had seen Ms. Mugabe personally change the diapers of many orphans. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d   Ms. Mugabe has also systematically secured support by using her wealth or access to state funds.   \u201cShe gave us thousands and thousands of chickens in all the provinces,\u201d said Angeline Muchemeyi, the chairwoman of the women\u2019s league in the Mashonaland West Province. \u201cAnd the new cars \u2014 we got Ford Rangers. She\u2019s good, she\u2019s very good to us, that lady.\u201d   Ms. Mugabe has treated potential rivals without mercy. She expelled from ZANU-PF a vice president and war hero,  Joice Mujuru , by accusing her of engaging in treason, practicing witchcraft and wearing short skirts. She also initiated a fierce attack against another vice president and leader of a rival faction, Emmerson Mnangagwa.   Supporters of Mr. Mnangagwa said Ms. Mugabe was being used by more experienced politicians to undermine their candidate.   \u201cShe\u2019s soft and inexperienced,\u201d said Douglas Mahiya, spokesman of the National Liberation War Veterans Association, which supports Mr. Mnangagwa. \u201cEven if she becomes president, it will be easier for these people to push her aside and take over.\u201d   Ms. Dongo, the former ZANU-PF official, said the first lady\u2019s political rise was part of the president\u2019s plan to build a family dynasty. \u201cThe kids are too young and don\u2019t have the capacity,\u201d she said.   None of the Mugabes\u2019 three children \u2014 the oldest is 28 \u2014 have shown any interest in politics. Mr. Mugabe has spoken of his disappointment in his two sons\u2019 poor academic performance. The older son, Robert Jr., who is studying in Dubai, often posts photos on social media of himself partying with different women.   In an  interview on his 92nd birthday , Mr. Mugabe said he had given his wife his approval to enter politics.   \u201cIt has proved to be rough waters,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she can cope with it. She is a rough swimmer.\u201d",

   "7. content": "Albert P. Brewer, who became the governor of Alabama after the death of Lurleen B. Wallace but lost his bid for a full term in 1970 during a nasty primary runoff against her husband, the segregationist former Gov. George C. Wallace, died on Jan 2 in Birmingham, Ala. He was 88.   The office of Gov. Robert Bentley confirmed the death without specifying a cause.   Because Mr. Wallace was forbidden by the state Constitution to serve successive four-year terms, his wife ran to succeed him in 1966 and won overwhelmingly. Mr. Brewer was elected lieutenant governor.   Mrs. Wallace, a political novice, was viewed largely as a proxy for her fiery husband, who had used his single term as governor as a springboard for an independent presidential campaign in 1968. He finished a distant third behind Richard M. Nixon and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey.   When Mrs. Wallace died of cancer 16 months into her term, Mr. Brewer became the acting governor.   Mr. Brewer regarded Mr. Wallace as a supporter and was planning to run for a full term. But as the former governor looked toward the 1972 presidential election, he determined that regaining office was critical to sustaining his national ambitions.   \u201cWe are not worried about who else might run,\u201d Mr. Brewer said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run on our record.\u201d   As governor, Mr. Brewer made it a point to work with black leaders, a departure from the pugnacious race-baiting of Mr. Wallace. He also enacted ethics reform, increased public funding for schools and created an economic development office.   \u201cHe was what Harper Lee said about her father, that he was an internal Christian,\u201d Wayne Flynt, a professor emeritus of history at Auburn University, who is writing a biography of Ms. Lee, said in an interview. \u201cThat meant that you could acknowledge the social trappings of race, but not personalize it. You could run as a segregationist, but treat blacks fairly and champion their rights.\u201d   He added, \u201cHe was a superb governor, and I say that in Alabama terms \u2014 not what you\u2019d expect in California.\u201d   Albert Preston Brewer was born on Oct. 26, 1928, in Bethel Springs, Tenn., to Daniel A. Brewer, a farmer who worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the former Clara Albert. As a child, he moved with his family to Decatur, Ala., where he went to local schools. He later received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.   He practiced law in Decatur and served in the state House of Representatives for three terms, including three years as the speaker, before deciding to run for lieutenant governor with Mr. Wallace\u2019s support.   The 1970 primary campaign between Mr. Brewer and Mr. Wallace was not heated at first; in fact, it was considered sedate. The mild-mannered Mr. Brewer emphasized that he would be a full-time governor and not spend time running for president, as his opponent was expected to do.   But late in the primary, Mr. Wallace denounced Mr. Brewer as a \u201csissy britches\u201d politician who had ridden Mrs. Wallace\u2019s \u201cskirt-tails\u201d to power and then joined with black militants to defeat him, according to the book \u201cMudslingers: The Twenty-Five Dirtiest Political Campaigns of All Time\u201d (2008), by Kerwin Swint.   Mr. Wallace went on to accuse the federal government trying to defeat him by sending 25 officials to register \u201cthe bloc vote,\u201d his code for black voters.   Mr. Wallace lost the primary. But Mr. Brewer\u2019s winning margin of just under 12,000 votes was not enough to avoid a runoff.   Mr. Wallace, fearing that he might lose again, altered his tactics. He and his supporters became strident about calling Mr. Brewer \u201cthe black man\u2019s candidate.\u201d A radio commercial, warning that Mr. Brewer would integrate the state police, tried to provoke fear in white women by suggesting that they might be stopped by a black highway patrolman. An unsigned circular claimed that Mr. Brewer\u2019s wife was an alcoholic.   In an  interview with the website AL.com  in 2014, Mr. Brewer remembered seeing a headline \u2014 \u201cWake up, Alabama! Blacks vow to take over Alabama\u201d \u2014 accompanying a photograph of a white girl surrounded by black boys.   \u201cIt was surprising that people would be so blatant,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAlways before, racist efforts in campaigns had been more subtle. They\u2019d use code words and things like that. But in this one, they were very open.\u201d   Major black leaders declared their support for Mr. Brewer. Black-owned radio stations urged their listeners not to \u201clet Dr. King\u2019s dream become a nightmare here in Alabama.\u201d   But Mr. Wallace won the runoff by more than 30,000 votes and subsequently won re-election.   During his concession, Mr. Brewer called the campaign \u201cthe dirtiest I\u2019ve ever observed.\u201d   Three years after the campaign,  John W. Dean , the former counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, testified that as much as $400,000 in leftover funds from Mr. Nixon\u2019s 1968 presidential campaign had been funneled to the Brewer campaign in an attempt to defeat Mr. Wallace.   Mr. Brewer ran for governor again in 1978, but finished third in the Democratic primary.   He went on to teach law at the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University in Birmingham, and he led a commission to reform Alabama\u2019s outdated Constitution.   Mr. Brewer is survived by a daughter, Alison Calhoun; three grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. His wife, Martha Farmer Brewer, died in 2006, and a second daughter, Becky Cooper, died in 2009.   Gordon Harvey, a history professor at Jacksonville State University, said that Mr. Brewer was the moderate governor Alabama had needed \u2014 \u201cefficient and truly interested in the common man\u201d \u2014 who understood that he could not force-feed integration to the state.   \u201cThe 1970 election was a fork in the road,\u201d Professor Harvey said. \u201cAlabama chose poorly and has suffered ever since.\u201d",

John Kasich\u2019s unsuccessful primary campaign against him.   Senator  Chuck Schumer , the New York Democrat who has a good working relationship with Mr. Trump, warned him recently that it was \u201creally dumb\u201d to take on the intelligence services. He followed up with a warning on Wednesday that the president-elect needed \u201cto calm down\u201d his Twitter usage.   He\u2019s not alone. In recent days, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have gently prodded him to drop the attacks on the intelligence community and mollify nervous Republicans by showing that he was moving ahead with forward-looking reforms of the sprawling intelligence-gathering bureaucracy, according to two people close to the discussions. \u201cHe can\u2019t afford this fight,\u201d one longtime adviser to Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s said it\u2019s time to move on \u2014 well, move on.\u201d   The decision to choose Dan Coats,  a popular former senator from Indiana , as director of national intelligence had been in the works for some time, the officials said, but Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers decided to announce the choice to ease concerns of a rift between the future Trump White House and the clandestine services.   It is less clear if Mr. Trump\u2019s admission reflects a long-term shift in strategy to appease his advisers or a momentary decision to escape a negative news cycle.   In the weeks leading up to the release of the report, the president-elect repeatedly cast doubt on an emerging consensus among intelligence officials, outside analysts and legislators from both parties that Mr. Putin had attempted to interfere with the election. As recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump  mused on Twitter  that his classified briefing may have been postponed to cook the results. \u201cThe \u2018Intelligence\u2019 briefing on so-called \u2018Russian hacking\u2019 was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\u201d   Officials denied that charge, and James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that he was concerned about \u201cdisparagement of the U.S. intelligence community.\u201d   By Friday morning, he was still defiant, but there was a substantial, if subtle, shift in tone, reflecting Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for masking a change in tune by keeping the volume at full blast. He began pushing blame from the national security establishment to a pair of his favorite political chew toys \u2014 Democrats and the news media.   Early in the day, a fired-up Mr. Trump  said in an interview  that he was the victim of a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d aimed at discrediting his presidency before it began. He suggested that the culprits were supporters of Hillary Clinton who were \u201cvery embarrassed\u201d by her loss.   A short time later, before he was due to receive the classified briefing, he tweeted out a rebuke of NBC for broadcasting a Thursday night report on the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings.   \u201cI am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it,\u201d  Mr. Trump wrote .   And finally, after the meeting,  he released a grudging statement : \u201cWhether it is our government, organizations, associations or businesses we need to aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks.\u201d   Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own party seemed unwilling to give him any leeway on the hacking issue, prodding him toward a more aggressive stance in confronting Russia.   \u201cThe men and women of our intelligence community are unparalleled,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhere is the urgency to make it clear to our adversaries that these attacks aren\u2019t cost-free?\u201d   And as Thursday\u2019s Armed Services Committee hearing showed, Senate Republicans, led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the committee, are intent on shielding the intelligence agencies from any attack, even one waged by their own president.   \u201cMcCain just got elected to a new six-year-term,\u201d said Mr. Weaver, a longtime adviser of Mr. McCain. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to let anyone attack people who protect the country\u2019s interests, and he\u2019s got nothing to lose.\u201d",

The nine-page ethics letter detailing Mr. Tillerson\u2019s commitments is the first of hundreds that will be made public in the coming weeks by members of President-elect  Donald J. Trump \u2019s cabinet and other top political appointees, presenting a historic test of the federal government\u2019s ability to identify conflicts of interest \u2014 and figure out ways to avoid them.   Mr. Trump has selected what would be the  wealthiest cabinet in modern American history,  filled with millionaires and billionaires with complicated financial portfolios. Mr. Tillerson is worth at least $300 million, but is hardly the richest among them: Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the commerce secretary nominee; Betsy DeVos, the education secretary nominee; and Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, each hold assets estimated at more than a billion dollars.   Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy son-in-law, is in the process of submitting his own forms as he prepares to take a formal White House position, people involved in the process said.   \u201cThe Office of Government Ethics is stressed, no doubt about that,\u201d said Robert Rizzi, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, who represents half a dozen Trump administration nominees going through the process, although he would not name them, citing confidentiality agreements. \u201cThey are having some difficulty keeping up.\u201d   All of the cabinet appointees and hundreds of others must submit a financial disclosure report detailing all the assets they own, their approximate value and income from any source they have made in the last year. Some of the nominees are so wealthy \u2014 and their assets so varied \u2014 there are not enough boxes on the standard form for them, lawyers involved in the process said.   The disclosures are then used by the agencies they are to take over, along with the Office of Government Ethics, to identify potential conflicts of interest and to negotiate ethics letters to be signed by the nominees, committing to avoid conflicts of interest.   At the same time, this class of wealthy incoming officials could save hundreds of millions of dollars in income tax payments, thanks to a special tax benefit created so that affluent Americans do not avoid federal government jobs.   The Trump administration, lawyers involved in the effort said, is behind where it should be in this process of disentangling conflicts of interest. This is partly a reflection of the extraordinary complexity of negotiating such conflict of interest agreements for incoming government officials worth hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars.   \u201cUsually, you just own a bunch of stocks and bonds, but he\u2019s getting people that own buildings and real estate and stuff you can\u2019t sell,\u201d said Alan Johnson, a New York-based compensation consultant. \u201cHe has Wilbur Ross, who is probably involved in a gazillion different things. I think it is going to be very complicated to try to disentangle all of these things.\u201d   Mr. Ross is a billionaire investor and former banker who made a fortune in steel, coal, telecommunications and other industries.   Under federal law, executive branch employees, including cabinet members, are prohibited from using their positions in the government to enrich themselves, meaning they are not allowed to participate in any particular matter that might directly financially benefit assets they own.   The best way to avoid such a conflict, said Lawrence M. Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, is to sell any assets \u2014 like Exxon Mobil stock or any individual company stock \u2014 and put proceeds into Treasury bonds or  mutual funds .   \u201cWe don\u2019t want the decisions that these individuals make to be influenced \u2014 in reality, or even appearance \u2014 by their own financial interests,\u201d Mr. Noble said. \u201cThey are working for the American people, and not to enrich themselves or their families.\u201d   The rules do not apply to the president and vice president, although ethics experts \u2014 and  even the Office of Government Ethics  \u2014 have urged Mr. Trump to divest his assets voluntarily to rid himself of potential concerns as he takes over the White House. He has thus far resisted such a move, saying that he plans to let his two oldest sons and other  Trump Organization  executives manage the business, perhaps with an outside monitor.   For appointees like Mr. Tillerson, the transition to government can have lucrative benefits: They can take advantage of measures in the tax code meant to be an incentive for wealthy people to consider public service jobs. The measure was put in place during the administration of the first President George Bush.   This tax benefit, which requires case-by-case approval by the  Office of Government Ethics,  allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on certain assets that they must sell in order to clear potential conflicts as they take office \u2014 essentially providing them with interest-free loans. To gain the tax advantage, the liquidated proceeds must then be invested in Treasury bonds, mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, and the official must seek a  certificate of divestiture .   Until now, Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, has been the most prominent example of a public official who has taken advantage of the divestiture certificate. In 2006, Mr. Paulson left Goldman Sachs and sold an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock, deferring taxes on the sale.   In his memo, Mr. Tillerson suggested that he was likely to seek such a certificate, and laid out a series of plans to divorce himself from financial engagements, board appointments and Exxon Mobil. This means he will most likely avoid capital gains taxes based on his sale of $50 million in Exxon Mobil stock he owns, as well as shares in more than 150 companies including Airbus and the Walt Disney Company, all of which he has promised to sell off within 90 days of his confirmation, his ethics documents suggest.   But a more complicated task involved resolving the fate of two million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, worth about $180 million, that Mr. Tillerson was set to receive over the next decade.   If he held on to this promised future payout from Exxon Mobil, he would still have a financial interest in matters that might affect the company and the oil industry. So  Exxon Mobil agreed  to take the unusual step of paying out the value of these sales and putting the money into an independent trust, with the money invested in neutral assets like Treasury bonds and mutual funds.   Under the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Tillerson, 64, goes back into the oil industry during the next decade, he will forfeit any money left in the account.   Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the administration of President George W. Bush, said this provision preventing Mr. Tillerson from returning to the oil industry was unusual and positive, as it removes the incentive for him to take steps while in government that might benefit an industry he planned to return to work for upon his departure.   \u201cIt gives up something I had never been able to get from other government officials \u2014 a promise not to go back to an industry from which you came,\u201d Mr. Painter said.   Still, some environmental activists say such steps cannot address what they argue will be Mr. Tillerson\u2019s inherent bias in the State Department.   \u201cIt is impossible for this man to remove his career, and frankly his personality, from the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Lena Moffitt, director of a Sierra Club campaign trying to reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. \u201cHe has been knee deep in this industry for more than four decades.\u201d",

But it was a campaign made enormously more powerful by the tools of the cyberage: private emails pilfered by hackers, an internet that reaches into most American homes, social media to promote its revelations and smear enemies.   What most Americans may have seen as a one-time effort \u2014 brazen meddling by Russia in the very core of American democracy \u2014 was, the report says, only part of a long-running information war that involves not just shadowy hackers and pop-up websites, but also more conventional news outlets, including the thriving Russian television network RT. The election intervention to damage  Hillary Clinton  and lift  Donald J. Trump  was the latest fusillade in a campaign that has gone on under the radar for years.   For the three agencies that produced the report \u2014 the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency \u2014 this is a heart-stopping moment: They have just told their new boss that he was elected with the vigorous, multifaceted help of an adversary, the thuggish autocrat who rules Russia.   \u201cPutin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,\u201d the report says, in unusually blunt and sweeping language.   Perhaps most arresting is the assessment that  Vladimir V. Putin , the Russian president, sees the election attack as payback \u2014 not offense, but defense. He has borne a serious grudge against Mrs. Clinton, who he believes denigrated him when she was secretary of state and encouraged the pro-democracy protests in Moscow that erupted against him in 2011.   Mr. Putin, the report says, sees the hidden hand of the United States in the leaking of the Panama Papers, files stolen from a law firm that exposed the wealth of his closest associates, secreted in offshore accounts. He even blames the United States for the exposure \u2014 carried out mainly by international sports authorities \u2014 of Russian athletes for their widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.   \u201cFrom the Russian perspective, this is punching back,\u201d said Christopher Porter, a former C.I.A. officer who now studies cyberattacks at the firm FireEye. \u201cWe may not think that\u2019s fair or justified, but that\u2019s the way they see it.\u201d   Mr. Porter said Mr. Putin had made no secret of his view that the United States, by promoting democracy in countries like Ukraine and Georgia, had interfered in Russia\u2019s backyard and was trying to undermine its power.   What is missing from the public report is what many Americans most eagerly anticipated: hard evidence to back up the agencies\u2019 claims that the Russian government engineered the election attack. That is a significant omission: Mr. Trump has been expressing skepticism for months that Russia was to blame, variously wondering whether it might have been China, or a 400-pound guy, or a guy from New Jersey.   There is only a whisper of dissent in the report \u2014 the eavesdroppers of the N.S.A. believe with only \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump, while their colleagues at the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. have \u201chigh confidence.\u201d   While most of Congress and much of the public appears to accept the agencies\u2019 findings, Mr. Trump\u2019s prominent doubts, accompanied at times by scorn for the agencies\u2019 competence, has rallied a diverse array of skeptics on the right and the left. Under the circumstances, many in Washington expected the agencies to make a strong public case to erase any uncertainty.   Instead, the message from the agencies essentially amounts to \u201ctrust us.\u201d There is no discussion of the forensics used to recognize the handiwork of known hacking groups, no mention of intercepted communications between the Kremlin and the hackers, no hint of spies reporting from inside Moscow\u2019s propaganda machinery.   At the top of every page of the report is a disclaimer that acknowledges what is missing: \u201cThis report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment; its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment, but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.\u201d   It offers an obvious reason for leaving out the details, declaring that including \u201cthe precise bases for its assessments\u201d would \u201creveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future.\u201d   The absence of any proof is especially surprising  in light of promises on Thursday  from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., that he would \u201cpush the envelope\u201d to try to make more information public. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama had directed officials to \u201cmake as much of it public as they possibly can.\u201d   That will not be enough for many, as the initial reaction showed. While some welcomed the scope of the report, many others were disappointed.   \u201cThis is big: CIA, NSA & FBI publish perhaps the most high-profile intelligence community assessment in US history,\u201d Thomas Rid, a professor at King\u2019s College London and an expert on  cyberwarfare ,  wrote on Twitter .   But Susan Hennessey, a former intelligence agency lawyer who is now the managing editor of the online journal Lawfare,  wrote : \u201cThe unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention.\u201d   Though the unclassified report is 25 pages long, counting the covers and several blank pages, the core analysis runs just five pages. That is less than the seven-page \u201cannex\u201d devoted to RT America, the television network. It is a description of the broadcaster from an intelligence report written in 2012, years before the election-related hacking took place.   The agencies \u201chave taken an all-source look at the broader Russian strategy,\u201d said Mr. Porter, the former C.I.A. officer. The detailed description of RT\u2019s tactics, though years old, he added, was included because they fit that strategy.   Mr. Trump may have been persuaded by  his classified briefing on Friday  on the Russian attack, which included everything that the unclassified report leaves out, even if  the statement he issued afterward seemed lukewarm . But this report is unlikely to change the minds of skeptics who, like the president-elect, remember the intelligence agencies\u2019 faulty assessments on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and fear being misled again.",

   "7. content": "ISSAQUAH, Wash. \u2014 Sometimes a book just gets loved to death. A Bible, or a copy of \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web,\u201d for that matter, can be opened only so many times, even by the gentlest reader, before its spine weakens and surrenders.   And here is a dirty little secret: Public libraries, despite their reputations for hushed wonder about the written word, can be rough places. Automated sorting machines, whirring conveyor belts and hard bins can break a book and shorten its life.   Donald Vass, who has spent the last 26 years mending and tending to books for the King County Public Library system here in the Seattle area, has seen both mechanical and human-inflicted damage and more. At 57 and with not many years left before retirement, he says he believes he will be the last full-time traditional bookbinder ever to take up shears, brushes and needles here. The skills take too long to learn, he said, and no one is being groomed to take his place in \u201cthe mendery,\u201d Room 111 at the library\u2019s central service center, where not so many years ago 10 people worked.   His is an ancient craft, and across many public library systems, a fading one. It stands in particularly stark contrast here, in a region where Amazon reinvented the book business and is now leading a high-tech boom. Seattle\u2019s glass-and-steel Central Library, designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus and completed in 2004, is ultramodern and angular. Software engineers, often with corporate ID cards still clipped to their shirts or belts, fill the cafes and bars.   Mr. Vass said the skills of book mending took him 15 years to master \u2014 how to diagnose a book\u2019s ills, what to patch and what to leave alone, how to hide evidence of a repair. He uses hypodermic needles to shoot bits of wheat paste into the corners of dog-eared covers to stiffen them, and an old-fashioned screw press to hold pages in place while adhesives dry.   He talks of his repaired books \u2014 60 to 80 a month \u2014 as if they were children heading out into a dangerous, unpredictable world.   \u201cI\u2019m reluctant, many times, to send them out because I know what they\u2019re going to be up against,\u201d said Mr. Vass, a soft-spoken man who is used to working alone.   Menderies, often called book hospitals, were once common in library systems across the nation. But the digital revolution, cost-control pressures and shifting reader tastes pushed many libraries away from paper and the maintenance of fragile old classics. The internet has made it easy to find used books to replace worn ones, and to borrow through interlibrary lending systems.   \u201cWe don\u2019t mend anymore; it\u2019s a lost art,\u201d said Alan Hall, the director of the public library of Steubenville and Jefferson County, Ohio, for the last 33 years. \u201cIt was a question of what you could do without, but it\u2019s also technology taking the place of it.\u201d   Even the humble word \u201cto mend,\u201d which derives from a French term for atonement, or \u201cto put right,\u201d is dropping out of circulation, librarians said. Conservation is now the operative term for the specialized, highly skilled work taught in graduate degree programs at places like New York University and the University of Delaware. Graduates of such schools are hired by government archives, university research libraries and some big public systems with deep reserves like the New York Public Library, and by art shops that will bring your grandmother\u2019s tattered copy of \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d back to luster at a price of $500 or more an hour.   \u201cConservation has gone through an accreditation/professionalization process,\u201d said Stephanie Lamson, the director of preservation services at the University of Washington Libraries. Technology plays a bigger role now too, supplanting some of the traditions of book repair that were based on long apprenticeship and practice. \u201cIt is quite interdisciplinary,\u201d Ms. Lamson said in an email, \u201cand draws from a wide range of techniques and technologies from microscopy to digital imaging.\u201d   Books themselves have been changing for an even longer period, Mr. Vass said, beginning in the mid-1800s, when growing literacy and a mass market \u2014 the era of dime novels \u2014 drove a switch from traditional stitching to much cheaper glues.   But those older glues were acidic time bombs that ate books alive, Mr. Vass said. \u201cThe people who did that first adhesive binding \u2014 they really have a lot to answer for.\u201d   Mr. Vass, who came to book repair through early training as a fine artist and painter, said his mendery had almost no modern technological tools and needs none. \u201cA computer does not do anything here \u2014 it only interrupts,\u201d he said. His prized piece of machinery is a large cast-iron board shears that had a previous life slicing boxes in a candy company. Made in the early 20th century, it can cut a book\u2019s replacement cover pieces, called boards, with absolute precision. He bought it at an estate sale, covered with dirt and rust, for $50 and restored it.   His one exception to technological intrusion is a CD player remote control that he keeps on his workbench. But what plays on the two small speakers above the door is also distinctively out of step with the modern world.   Mr. Vass listens to medieval and Renaissance music, and what he hears, in the ethereal choral and cathedral pieces written by composers like Christopher Tye, who lived in England in the 1500s, or Jehan de Lescurel, a French poet and composer of the 1400s, creates what Mr. Vass called \u201ca perfect harmony\u201d with his work. The work of Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote music in the 1700s, is an exception to the mendery\u2019s typical Top 40, which tilts toward tunes from the 13th to 16th centuries. \u201cBach seems like a modern composer to me,\u201d Mr. Vass said with a smile.   Love of books pervades the work of the mendery \u2014 and the desire to protect them from the harsh threats of the outside world. Damage from automated library sorting and processing machines, for example, has led Mr. Vass to create cardboard box covers to fit newly repaired volumes, like a kind of armored overcoat.   Library patrons, worried or grieving over a damaged or worn-out book \u2014 often a childhood treasure \u2014 sometimes find Mr. Vass and ask for his help. If time allows, he said, he does the work and charges nothing, justifying such side projects, he said, in that they often hone his skills.   Words leap occasionally from the pages he works on, in an author\u2019s voice, usually long dead, speaking to him. He keeps one such quote prominently on his desk:   \u201cWhatever struggle you have met, find its meaning and it will cease to be a struggle.\u201d    He remembers nothing else about the book, neither title nor author. But he knows that he sent it back out, mended and ready to fight on for another day.",

Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously.   The victim  in the attack here , an 18-year-old white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail.   The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic.   \u201cI\u2019m wondering as I\u2019m hearing this, \u2018Where was the sense of decency?\u2019 \u201d Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked. In explaining her denial of bail, she added, \u201cHow do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person?\u201d   People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to  a Justice Department report  based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized.   But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously.   \u201cThere are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. \u201cIn a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?\u201d   Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to  a recent case in Idaho , where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months.   Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was  sentenced to probation  rather than prison.   \u201cWe have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,\u201d said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cWhat we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, \u2018Oh, this case is hard, it\u2019s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they\u2019re not credible, or they won\u2019t stand up to cross-examination.\u2019\u201d   Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex.  Forty-six of the 50  states have hate crimes laws, according to the Anti-Defamation League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group.   Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, \u201cPeople are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what\u2019s worse is that there\u2019s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it\u2019s a parent or caregiver.\u201d",

The tension between two countries that should be jointly confronting North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and China\u2019s spreading influence prompted Washington to mediate an agreement in December 2015 in which Japan apologized and promised $8.3 million to care for the surviving women. The deal was meant to be a \u201cfinal and irreversible resolution\u201d to the matter.   But many Koreans, including some of the surviving women, felt the deal fell far short of their demand that Japan accept legal responsibility and offer formal reparations. On Dec. 28, the first anniversary of the agreement, Korean activists installed another statue, this one in front of the Japanese Consulate in Busan, South Korea\u2019s second-largest city. The local government immediately removed it, but then relented under acute public pressure.   On Friday,  Japan recalled its ambassador to South Korea  and suspended negotiations over an arrangement to help Seoul stabilize its currency, along with other high-level economic talks.   The Japanese are right to argue that the statue violates the spirit of the 2015 agreement. But the Koreans can also argue that the recent visit by Japan\u2019s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where a number of convicted war criminals are commemorated, is evidence that the Japanese do not fully acknowledge the crimes of their militarist past.   What is needed is recognition on both sides, and in Washington, that the December 2015 agreement cannot be allowed to collapse, along with a concerted effort to calm the waters. Alas, that is a tall order at this juncture: Park Geun-hye, the South Korean president who signed the agreement with Japan, has been suspended from office over a corruption scandal, and Washington awaits a president whose policies on Asia are far from clear. On this issue, however, the risks of inaction should be clear enough.",

Trump  in the Oval Office, the nation\u2019s top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on Friday to Mr. Trump.   The officials presented their unanimous conclusions to Mr. Trump in a two-hour briefing at Trump Tower in New York that brought the leaders of America\u2019s intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic, the president-elect, who has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia\u2019s role. The meeting came just two weeks before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of Congress.   Soon after leaving the meeting, intelligence officials  released the  declassified,   damning report  that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing Russian effort to weaken the United States government and its democratic institutions. The report \u2014 a virtually unheard-of, real-time revelation by the American intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them \u2014 made the case that Mr. Trump was the favored candidate of Mr. Putin.   The Russian leader, the report said, sought to denigrate Mrs. Clinton, and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to President Obama a day earlier: Mr. Trump\u2019s victory followed a complicated, multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the Republican win.   The 25-page report did not conclude that Russian involvement tipped the election to Mr. Trump.   The public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version, which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from \u201cimplants\u201d that the United States and its allies have put in Russian computer networks.   Much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt Kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the report\u2019s more serious conclusions.   The report may be a political blow to Mr. Trump. But it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the Iraq war.   The declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of Mr. Putin and his security services, including the creation of the online Guccifer 2.0 persona and  DCLeaks.com  to release information gained from the hacks to the public.   \u201cPutin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,\u201d the report by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies concluded.   Mr. Trump, whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the country\u2019s intelligence services on Twitter since Election Day, issued a written statement that appeared to concede some Russian involvement. But Mr. Trump said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin had sought to aid his candidacy, other than insisting that he still believes the Russian attacks had no effect on the outcome.   The president-elect\u2019s written statement came just hours after Mr. Trump  told T he New York Times  in an interview that the storm surrounding Russian hacking was nothing more than a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d carried out by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election. Speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on Russia.   \u201cChina, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,\u201d he said, referring to the breach of computers at the Office of Personnel Management in late 2014 and early 2015. \u201cHow come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt.\u201d   Later, Mr. Trump sought to blame the Democrats for any cyberattacks that might have occurred. \u201cGross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place,\u201d  he said in a Twitter  message posted about 11 p.m. \u201cThe Republican National Committee had strong defense!\u201d   Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters that he and Mr. Trump had \u201cappreciated the presentation\u201d by the intelligence officials and described the conversation as \u201crespectful.\u201d Mr. Pence said the new administration would take aggressive action \u201cto combat cyberattacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future.\u201d   Mr. Trump, who has consistently questioned the evidence of Russian hacking during the election, did so again Friday before he met with the intelligence officials. Asked why he thought there was so much attention on the Russian cyberattacks, the president-elect said the motivation was political.   He also repeated his criticism of the American intelligence agencies, saying that \u201ca lot of mistakes were made\u201d in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying, as he has repeatedly, that \u201cweapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time.\u201d   But after meeting with the intelligence officials, Mr. Trump appeared to moderate his position, conceding that \u201cRussia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee.\u201d   The report described a broad campaign of covert operations, including the \u201ctrolling\u201d on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia\u2019s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining \u201caccess to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,\u201d it concluded \u2014 as officials have publicly \u2014 that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8.   The report, reflecting the assessments of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election.   \u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American \u201cpolitical processes\u201d or public opinion.   The intelligence agencies also concluded \u201cwith high confidence\u201d that Russia\u2019s main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a \u201cpersona\u201d called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta.   When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. \u201crelayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.\u201d The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published.   The role of RT \u2014 the Russian English-language news organization that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation \u2014 in the Kremlin\u2019s effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the Russian campaign. An annex in the report on RT, which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public, takes up eight pages of the report\u2019s 14-page main section.   The report\u2019s unequivocal assessment of RT presents an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to serve as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT\u2019s news programs and in December 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in Russia and attend its lavish anniversary party, where he sat at the elbow of Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn has since defended his speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC.   The report also stated that Russia collected data \u201con some Republican-affiliated targets,\u201d but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested.   Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions.   The British role, which has been closely held, is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or informants outside the United States, as emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee flowed out of the country.   The conclusions in the report were described on Thursday to President Obama and on Friday to Mr. Trump by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A.; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency; and James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I.   The key to the public report\u2019s assessment is that Russia\u2019s motives \u201cevolved over the course of the campaign.\u201d When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused \u201con undermining her future presidency,\u201d with pro-Kremlin bloggers preparing a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #DemocracyRIP. It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011.   Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first  gained access to the Democratic National Committee \u2019s  networks . Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until \u201cat least June 2016,\u201d the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks.",

The meeting, held in a conference room on the 42nd floor with a view of New Jersey, lasted barely an hour. In answering questions from editors, Mr. Trump addressed health care, climate change, relations with Russia, women\u2019s issues and abortion rights. Mr. Trump mostly reiterated plans or policies he has discussed publicly for months, according to two people who were apprised of the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to talk.   When asked about health care, for instance, he told the group that he did not want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act until he had another plan in place, one of the people said. Several editors contacted declined to discuss the meeting, which was off the record. \u201cNot my preference,\u201d Mr. Carter wrote in an email. \u201cBut I will abide by that.\u201d A Conde\u0301 Nast spokesman declined to comment.   Ms. Wintour visited Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in mid-December after she had criticized the Trump Foundation and suggested that Mr. Trump and his family would personally profit from his time in the White House. Ms. Wintour, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, later apologized for the comments.   Mr. Trump  was photographed  entering Conde\u0301 Nast\u2019s headquarters alongside Michael Flynn, his choice to be national security adviser. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, and Kellyanne Conway, his incoming counselor, were also there.   Hilary Rosen, a political strategist for SKD Knickerbocker in Washington, said all of Conde\u0301 Nast\u2019s brands have had a relationship with presidential families over the years. \u201cIt is a rich opportunity for content,\u201d she said. Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue, for example. At the same, Ms. Rosen added, \u201cIt\u2019s not like their progressive agenda is going to have an impact on Trump.\u201d   Ms. Rosen, who had close ties to the Clinton campaign, characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings with media outlets as \u201cnothing more than an attempt by his team\u2019s part to take the horns off.\u201d   In a phone interview on Friday night, Ms. Conway declined to discuss the substance of the meeting, but said it was an opportunity for Mr. Trump to \u201cconnect with the media.\u201d She added that \u201cno consideration was given to image.\u201d   In December, Mr. Trump criticized Vanity Fair on Twitter after the magazine gave the restaurant in Trump Tower a bad review. Subscription sales have soared in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism, the magazine said. And Vanity Fair  printed his tweet on its latest cover .",

   "7. content": "ISTANBUL \u2014 An Islamic State disciple kills 39 New Year\u2019s revelers  at an Istanbul nightclub . A gunman with a police badge  assassinates Russia\u2019s ambassador  at an Ankara reception. Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central  Turkey  and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match.   Those assaults were just in the last few weeks, which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir, where at least two civilians were killed, seem relatively minor.   The 75 million people of  Turkey , the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy, are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West.   Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees, a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and  a failed military coup  \u2014 all tied, in the eyes of many Turks,  to American negligence, or malice , or both.   President  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies, including the news media, and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity.   While Mr. Erdogan\u2019s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country, many Turks, frightened and uncertain, are not complaining. They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories.   Some are even embracing the advent of President-elect Donald J. Trump, despite his anti-Muslim statements, viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him.   In some ways, political historians and scholars say, what is happening in Turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the 2015 attacks in France and, most recently, the response to attacks in Germany.   In all of them, many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties, government powers grew, fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance, and dissent was regarded with suspicion.   \u201cI think there are a lot of similar tendencies, and it leads to, in an extreme case, what we\u2019re seeing in Turkey,\u201d said  Steven A. Cook , a senior fellow for Middle East and African Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.   Still, Mr. Cook said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that far a leap to go to an extreme \u2014 can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?\u201d   On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government,  lashed out  at Western news coverage,  including an article in The New York Times , that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey.   Describing the article as \u201can attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States.   She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C.I.A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application.   In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P.K.K., the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy.   In her Friday column, headlined \u201cWhy Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration,\u201d she added, \u201cdo they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?\u201d   In another parallel to post-9/11 America, the Turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy, even if democratic practices are eroded to do so.   The comparison was not lost on Turkish scholars, even those critical of Mr. Erdogan, who were in the United States when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked.   \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism, even among academics,\u201d said  Kemal Kirisci , a senior fellow and director of The Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, recalling his own memories of living in America. \u201cI felt intimidated intellectually, almost felt censured.\u201d   After the coup attempt,  the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence , renaming a bridge in Istanbul and a square in Ankara, and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government.   At year\u2019s end, the prime minister\u2019s office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in Turkey. Inside a black velvet box, with a silver clasp, was a small marble chunk, described as rubble from the Parliament building in Ankara, retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt.   A note said that the rock \u201cis presented to you as a symbol of Turkey\u2019s devotion to democracy.\u201d   And like American leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, urged Turks this week to carry on. \u201cOur citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives,\u201d Mr. Yildirim said in a speech. \u201cIf they do, it will be serving the purposes of the terror group.\u201d   Mr. Erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the West\u2019s reaction to Turkey, and say that some of the same measures Turkey is taking to combat terrorism, like resorting to emergency rule, have been embraced in the West, particularly in France.   It is this disconnect \u2014 between how Turkey perceives its own experience and the West\u2019s reaction to events in Turkey \u2014 that has contributed to Turkey pulling away from its NATO allies, and moving closer to Russia.   \u201cIn France there is emergency rule for three months, and again for three months, and lately for six months, in total for a year,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in September. \u201cIs anyone from around the world asking France, \u2018why did you declare emergency rule for a year?\u2019\u201d   Mr. Erdogan emphasized that the violence Turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like France. \u201cMy brothers, Turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with France, and more importantly we faced a coup attempt,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom this perspective I believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule, and support it.\u201d   In a speech on Friday, Mr. Erdogan underscored the deep traumas Turkey has suffered in recent years.   \u201cI do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe became a unique example in history. We showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges.\u201d   Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters say they are especially upset over how the West has reacted to Turkey\u2019s response to terrorism, saying they had expected solidarity, not criticism.   \u201cThis is an obvious, very serious and problematic disrespect against Turkey\u2019s right to defend itself against terror,\u201d said Mustafa Yeneroglu, a member of Parliament with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Islamist Justice and Development Party.   Mr. Yeneroglu, the head of Parliament\u2019s human rights committee, said Turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts.   \u201cIf there is no security, there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,\u201d he said. \u201cThis situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions, \u2018security or liberty?\u2019 This is not only valid for Turkey but for all other liberal democracies.\u201d   Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that Turkey\u2019s broad crackdown \u2014 in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail \u2014 has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe.   \u201cOn the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,\u201d said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists.   He continued, \u201cthere is emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale.\u201d   Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup, put it this way: \u201cYes,  ISIS  is attacking. The P.K.K. is attacking. There was this coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150 journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people.\u201d   Marc Pierini , a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to Turkey, said the post-coup purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically, compromised the country\u2019s ability to protect the public.   Mr. Pierini also took issue with the government\u2019s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate.   \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen after the coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists \u2014 so there is no limit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you start pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And that\u2019s where we stand.\u201d",

   "7. content": "The office of the director of national intelligence on Friday released a long-awaited unclassified version of its report for President Obama on what the intelligence agencies said was a multifaceted attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. The report included only the agencies\u2019 conclusions, not the actual intelligence or technical information on which they were based.    Here are some major findings, with comments by The New York Times.  The full report is available here.   \u2022 In unequivocal language, the report pins responsibility for the election attack directly on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by Kremlin supporters.   \u2022 United States officials believe Mr. Putin wants to damage the image of American democracy to make it less attractive to Russians and their neighbors.   _____   \u2022 Notably, the report concludes that Russia sought not only to damage Hillary Clinton, whom it thought likely to win, but actually tried to help elect Donald J. Trump.   \u2022 The C.I.A., F.B.I. and N.S.A. agreed on nearly everything in the report, but here we see that the N.S.A. was less certain than the other agencies that Russia was trying to help Mr. Trump.   _____   \u2022 An important insight into Mr. Putin\u2019s thinking: He already blamed the United States for multiple campaigns against Russia, including the release of the  Panama Papers , showing offshore accounts hiding the fortunes of some of his closest friends and allies, and the exposure of Russian athletes for doping. For him, this was payback.   \u2022 There is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers, and while American officials complained of Russian doping, there is no basis to suggest that they fabricated evidence of it.   _____   \u2022 The election attack was personal, the report concludes: Mr. Putin thought Mrs. Clinton had insulted him and encouraged  demonstrations against him  in Russia.   _____   \u2022 A new observation: Mr. Putin has enjoyed close relations with some Western leaders who had personal business ties to Russia. The report suggests he may have seen Mr. Trump in a similar light, though the Trump Organization has no major projects in Russia.   _____   \u2022 While the intelligence agencies see the leak of hacked materials to influence the election as \u201cunprecedented,\u201d they view it as part of a familiar Russian information strategy using every form of contemporary media to influence public opinion.   _____   \u2022 The report\u2019s most specific finding on hacking tracks with what cybersecurity experts have said: that two different hacking groups attacked Democratic targets, one described here as \u201cRussian intelligence,\u201d the other more specifically as the G.R.U., Russian military intelligence.   \u2022 Contrary to expectations, the report says nothing about the forensic analysis or American spying on which the conclusions are based.   _____   \u2022 Here the report accuses the Russian government of going beyond standard cyberespionage, in which hacking is used to get information, to an attack by releasing the information to influence the election.   \u2022 As expected, the agencies accuse the G.R.U. of being behind Guccifer 2.0 and  DCLeaks.com , two outlets that released hacked emails and documents, and with supplying hacked emails to WikiLeaks, though it does not suggest WikiLeaks editors necessarily knew the source.   _____   \u2022 The report cites positive Russian news coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as confirmation that Mr. Putin\u2019s government took sides in the election.   \u2022 In the agencies\u2019 view, the Russian government sees Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as one in a series of wins for populist movements championed by Mr. Putin.   _____   \u2022 The report suggests that Mr. Putin believes the combination of hacking and leaks is a low-risk, high-impact way to influence other countries \u2014 and that Russia is likely to keep trying the same methods against the United States and other countries.",

   "6. description": "WASHINGTON \u2014  Michelle Obama  fought back tears on Friday during her  last public remarks as first lady , overcome with emotion as she reflected on her eight years in the White House and delivered an intensely personal message of empowerment through education, one of her cherished causes. \u201cBeing your first lady has been the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Mrs. Obama told an audience of educators in the East Room, her voice catching as her eyes shone with tears. \"And I hope I\u2019ve made you proud.\u201d   Her 21-minute speech, an appeal for hope and inclusiveness as the salves to the forces of fear and division, carried an implicit rebuke to President-elect Donald J.

   "7. content": "WASHINGTON \u2014  Michelle Obama  fought back tears on Friday during her  last public remarks as first lady , overcome with emotion as she reflected on her eight years in the White House and delivered an intensely personal message of empowerment through education, one of her cherished causes.   \u201cBeing your first lady has been the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Mrs. Obama told an audience of educators in the East Room, her voice catching as her eyes shone with tears. \"And I hope I\u2019ve made you proud.\u201d   Her 21-minute speech, an appeal for hope and inclusiveness as the salves to the forces of fear and division, carried an implicit rebuke to President-elect Donald J.

The speech was a striking finale for Mrs. Obama, once a reluctant political spouse who disdained the partisan fray, but who  evolved  over eight years into a popular and high-profile first lady, spending the final months of her husband\u2019s presidency as a uniquely powerful voice for Democrats against Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.   On Friday, Mrs. Obama showed glimpses of her oft-expressed impatience to be finished with the fishbowl-like quality of life in the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the end!\u201d she exclaimed with a broad smile, but also the wistfulness of a person preparing to leave behind a role in which she had come to thrive.   The setting was a fitting one for Mrs. Obama\u2019s valedictory, encapsulating the combination of \u201cmom in chief\u201d normalcy and celebrity star power that she has brought to her public initiatives, including the  higher education project  being celebrated Friday, the \u201c Let\u2019s Move \u201d anti-obesity program and her \u201c Joining F orces \u201d effort to support military families. School counselors being honored for their work filled the East Room, but so did boldfaced names, including the actress Connie Britton, the pop star Usher and the comedian Jay Pharoah, who have lent their talents to promoting Mrs. Obama\u2019s causes.   She alluded to the challenges inherent in the first lady role, which brings the highest degrees of public scrutiny but none of the built-in levers of power available to the rest of the White House. Her aides, Mrs. Obama said as she thanked them by name, \u201chave worked miracles without any staff or budget to speak of \u2014 which is how we roll in the first lady\u2019s office.\u201d   Her voice began to thicken when Mrs. Obama, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago and was in the first generation of her family to attend college, spoke of her father, part of a discourse on the power of hope to fuel opportunity.   \u201cThe hope of folks like my dad, who got up every day to do his job at the city water plant, the hope that one day his kids would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed of,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of hope that every single one of us \u2014 politicians, parents, preachers, all of us \u2014 need to be providing for our young people, because that is what moves this country forward every single day.\u201d   The audience rose to applaud, and as Mrs. Obama struggled to keep her emotions in check, audience members and attendees who were assembled behind her for the speech wiped away their own tears.   \u201cLead by example with hope, never fear,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cAnd know that I will be with you, rooting for you and working to support you for the rest of my life.\u201d",

   "7. content": "The rapper and actor Tip Harris, better known as T. I., has never hesitated to speak his mind or wade into controversy.

The tipping point may have come last summer when, within a day of each other, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were fatally shot by police officers. He met with several activists, including Harry Belafonte and the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, to ask for advice. \u201cThe main thing is educating ourselves on the issues and just remaining aware,\u201d Mr. Harris said of the lessons from those meetings.   In addition to speaking on panels, marching in protests and sharing political views on late-night talk shows, Mr. Harris released an EP, \u201cUs or Else,\u201d followed by a full album, \u201cUs or Else: Letter to the System,\u201d that bluntly addresses police harassment. Before releasing his first letter, a reflection on President Obama\u2019s impact, on Friday, he spoke about his hopes for his writing, and the next president. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.    What do you hope to accomplish through these letters?   My first purpose is to communicate and share my thoughts and try to be a voice for the people who may be thinking of something to say but, for some reason, may not be able to say it or not have the platform to say it. Using my platform to be a voice for those who can\u2019t speak for themselves.   Do you think Obama\u2019s impact was mostly symbolic, or were there tangible accomplishments , especially for black people?   First and foremost was the symbolic message, saying that whatever you are, whatever color your skin is, you don\u2019t have to be a white man to be president. Obama opened the door to show it can happen, it can be done, your efforts can be paid off in a very, very large capacity as long as you continue to work and educate yourself and take the necessary steps. That\u2019s immeasurable.   Do you have any expectations of what life will be like under President Trump?   It\u2019s time for me to sit back and observe, see what it will be like. I already have my own opinions, information, what I think it will be like. But that isn\u2019t as important as the reality. I don\u2019t have to talk about or wonder what it will be like. I will have to live through it. I don\u2019t want to be presumptuous, I don\u2019t want to be premature in my criticism.   It seems like Obama\u2019s presidency spoke to hip-hop. Is there going to be a loss for rap without a president like Obama?   I don\u2019t think at this present moment in time it\u2019s possible for any president to assume a relevant position in the community, in the culture, without reaching out or having some knowledge of what\u2019s going on in the world of hip-hop. You can\u2019t be disconnected from the most impactful culture in this nation.   You entered humbly into our worlds from the streets of the South Side of Chicago and galvanized a generation. You resonated from the barbershops to the airwaves to the streets of every hood across America. Many of US did not know your name, nor did we truly understand the impact you would have on the world in the years, months and days that followed.   As I reflect, I am filled with gratitude, outrage, grief, anger, humility and appreciation, both for the things you helped bring to light and the many things we still have yet to realize.   For years you fought to keep this nation from the very thing we have now become.   For years, many of US failed you because, as I\u2019ve said before, we were not all ready for the change you wanted to bring about.   But rest assured that we heard you. Rest assured that we felt you and rest assured that your legacy will live on long after your presidency.   Not only did you impact a nation, but you defined a culture and you shook up and woke up a generation.   A generation that unfortunately fears more than ever being further wounded, overlooked, abused, neglected and having to fight for what we now understand is not such a basic right and that is the plight for equality and basic human dignity.   While many of US act like this is something new, those of US who have been fighting, marching and writing about it know that inequality, hatred and bigotry has crippled and silenced US for a very long time. Although we are wounded, don\u2019t count US out of the fight.   We thank you for helping US face and focus on the very issues that plague our communities and diminishes US all. While I, too, responsibly admit to engaging in the behaviors that further perpetuates the negative stigma in our communities, I wanted to thank you for looking beyond our shortcomings.   As I reflect back on my teenage years when I heard my favorite rapper and person, Tupac Shakur, tell me we weren\u2019t ready for a black president, leaving me in nodding in agreement until you brought US the audacity of hope and reminded US that yes we can.   As you transition out of office, we continue to watch you carry out your final agenda with precision, integrity and purpose. That is what we will remember as signature Obama.   For every one of US who has been touched by you and tasked with a choice between finding a way or walking away, I say we can and must do more.   We cannot afford to live in a prolonged state of grief, but must remember that we have no choice but to dust ourselves off, wipe off our wounds and move beyond this barren state of shock.   We will forever be grateful to you and your family, the graceful intelligent compassionate first lady, Mrs. Obama, as well as your beautiful daughters Sasha and Malia for their collective sacrifices for US. WE will continue to stand with you and alongside those who make a personal investment in US. We will continue to remain committed to causes that are bigger than ourselves. We will continue to remind ourselves that, Yes, We still can!",

But the declassified report contained no information about how the agencies had collected their data or had come to their conclusions. So it is bound to be attacked by skeptics and by partisans of Mr. Trump, who see the review as a political effort to impugn the legitimacy of his election. Intelligence officials have rejected that view.   The report, reflecting the assessments of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. \u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American \u201cpolitical processes\u201d or public opinion.   The intelligence agencies also concluded \u201cwith high confidence\u201d that Russia\u2019s main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a \u201cpersona\u201d called Guccifer 2.0 and a website,  DCLeaks.com , to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta.   When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. \u201crelayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.\u201d The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published.   The report makes clear that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump in part because he had previous success dealing with \u201cWestern political leaders whose business interests made them more disposed to deal with Russia\u201d \u2014 it named a former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, as an example \u2014 and in part because he viewed Mr. Trump as a more likely ally in forming Russia\u2019s version of a counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump described his eagerness to do so in an interview with  The New York Times  in March 2016.   The report also stated that Russia collected data \u201con some Republican-affiliated targets,\u201d but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested.   The report\u2019s introduction called the public document a summation of \u201ca highly classified assessment.\u201d The classified version, officials say, comes in two forms \u2014 one for Congress and another, called a \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d report, for select members of Congress and top officials of the incoming and outgoing governments.   The compartmentalized version contains information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from \u201cimplants\u201d that the United States and its allies have put in Russian networks.   The conclusions were described to Mr. Obama on Thursday and to Mr. Trump on Friday by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A.; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency; and James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I.   The key to the report\u2019s assessment is that Russia\u2019s motives \u201cevolved over the course of the campaign.\u201d When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused \u201con undermining her future presidency.\u201d It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011.   Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s networks. Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until \u201cat least June 2016,\u201d the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks.   Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report on Russian hacking activity have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow had hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions.   Mr. Trump was briefed by senior intelligence officials for nearly two hours on Friday, describing the briefing in a statement as \u201ca constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the intelligence community.\u201d   It is unclear whether they highlighted the British role, which has been closely held, in the briefing. But it is a critical part of the timeline, because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or human sources outside the United States, as emails and other data from the D.N.C. flowed out of the country.   \u201cThe British picked it up, and we may have had it at about the same time,\u201d said one cyberexpert who has been briefed on the findings. British intelligence \u2014 especially the signals intelligence unit, GCHQ \u2014 has a major role in tracking Russian activity.",

As Canadians set out to celebrate all that the country has become and what they have achieved since then, the Times\u2019s Travel editors have been looking north. And for their 12th annual  Places to Go  list, they have ranked Canada as the world\u2019s top travel destination.   \u201cCanada has it all (O.K., maybe not tropical beaches),\u201d the  editors wrote . \u201cIt\u2019s a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta.\u201d   As many Canadian readers of this newsletter have pointed out in emails, the editors also noted that Canada\u2019s wonders are not well known by many of the country\u2019s American neighbors.   \u201cLet\u2019s face it, clich\u00e9s of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world,\u201d the editors wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar.\u201d   As part of Places to Go, five Canadian authors  contributed essays about places in Canada  \u201cthat have lodged in their psyches.\u201d For Madeleine Thien, the author of  \u201cDo Not Say We Have Nothing,\u201d  which was recently awarded both the  Scotiabank Giller Prize  and the  Governor General\u2019s Literary Award for Fiction , that place is Port Hardy, British Columbia, which is on the northern point of Vancouver Island.   \u201cPort Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a resource-dependent town with a complex human and environmental history,\u201d Ms. Thien wrote. \u201cThe land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to \u2018smoke of the world,\u2019 was taken into ownership \u2014 both private and national \u2014 by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws.\u201d   We are also asking everyone, through Facebook, to  share their recommendations  for places to visit in Canada.   The Times\u2019s 360 Degree video producers also take you, in a virtual way, to the Sky Pilot Suspension Bridge in Squamish, British Columbia. The result depends on your opinion of dizzying heights.   While there is no signature event on the scale of  Expo 67 , the world\u2019s fair that was the highlight of the centennial celebrations 50 years ago, Canadians will still be celebrating the country\u2019s birthday in a variety of ways this year, and we will be reporting on some of them.   Finally, in Travel, and related to Canada\u2019s top destination status, the  36 Hours feature comes to Ottawa , the city where I live. Remy Scalza, a writer from Vancouver, B.C., visited some classic but still worthwhile destinations, like Parliament Hill. Perhaps inevitably, he ate a  BeaverTail , a flat, deep fried piece of dough. But he also made his way to neighborhoods that visitors often overlook, like Hintonburg (or Wellington West, as it has come to be known since its revival), and he sought out some of the city\u2019s best breads and pastries at a bakery hidden in a gritty industrial complex.   Grounded  Canada also had a travel-related news event this week. Calgary police arrested an airline pilot who was apparently so drunk that he  passed out in the cockpit  of an airliner that was preparing to take off with 99 passengers bound for the sun and warmth of Mexico.   Ice Battles  Stephen Smith told the story of how the  228th Overseas Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force  briefly became one of hockey\u2019s best teams in the middle of World War I.   Ice Ownership  At 23, Alexandre Tanguay is one of the youngest team owners in professional sports. Tal Pinchevsky  looked into the story  of Mr. Tanguay, a member of a leading Quebec hockey family, who owns the Rimouski Oceanic of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League while he studies finance at the University of Quebec.   Ice Heartbreak  Canada lost the world junior hockey championship in Montreal on Thursday in a shootout with the United States. While the tournament was underway, Dhiren Mahiban looked into  the lifelong friendships  some players form while competing for their country as juniors on national teams \u2014 friendships that endure through later professional rivalries in the National Hockey League.   Here are some articles from The Times over the last week, not necessarily related to Canada and perhaps overlooked, that I found interesting:   \u2014 China, which Canada has identified as a potential oil customer, plans to  spend more than $360 billion  on renewable energy through 2020.   \u2014 After a critic took exception to the season opener of the television series \u201cSherlock,\u201d one of the creators of the series followed the lead of Arthur Conan Doyle and  responded in verse .   \u2014  Jean Vuarnet,  the French Olympian who reshaped the form of downhill skiing, has died at the age of 83.   \u2014 While Canada was in World War I from the beginning, the United States fought only briefly at the end. But the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d nevertheless  influenced American art .",

Later in the morning, soldiers launched a similar mutiny in the city of Daloa, according to Yolande Kouame, who works for a financial institution there. She said that shots had been fired at about 10 a.m. and that soldiers had blocked entrances into town.   There were news reports of a similar disturbance in the northern city of Korhogo.   In recent years, Ivory Coast has shed its violent past to become one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies. It is the world\u2019s largest producer of cocoa, and President Alassane Ouattara has invested in roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that have lured back multinational corporations that fled during the conflict. The country celebrated its first peaceful presidential election in two decades when Mr. Outtara was  re-elected  in 2015.   But last year, militants  stormed a popular strip of resorts  and killed more than a dozen people, leaving bodies strewn across a beach. The North African affiliate of Al Qaeda,  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , claimed responsibility for  the attack , one in a series to hit West African capitals. Ivory Coast is also struggling with a serious deforestation problem and has been  evicting cocoa-farming squatters  from its lush, protected forests.   Tensions from past conflicts simmer, but the soldiers\u2019 actions on Friday took Ivorians by surprise.   Just after midnight on Friday, troops broke into a military barracks in Bouak\u00e9, according to the Defense Ministry, and stole a cache of weapons. The renegade soldiers were circling the city on motorbikes, firing shots in the air to disperse crowds, according to Moussa Coulibaly, 30, a student from Bouak\u00e9. He said schools were closed, and the streets of the normally bustling city were quieter than usual.   Dominique Koffi, a moped repairman in the city, said a lot of gunfire could be heard early Friday morning in the city center. \u201cThen we saw uniformed military men around town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got scared and left. The city is paralyzed and shops are closed because of fear.\u201d   Military leaders have been talking with the renegade soldiers, according to Ivory Coast\u2019s defense minister, Alain Richard Donwahi, who appeared on national television Friday afternoon. The soldiers are seeking raises, bonuses and shorter tenures of military service, among other issues, he said.   \u201cThere are ongoing negotiations between the authorities and the soldiers,\u201d Nicolas Djibo, the mayor of Bouak\u00e9, said in a telephone interview.   Mr. Djibo said he was optimistic that the situation would be resolved by day\u2019s end, but that it had become a national issue that was beyond his authority.   \u201cThe mayor can\u2019t give security guarantees,\u201d he said.   In a statement, the Defense Ministry urged all soldiers \u201cto remain calm and return to the barracks, with a view to finding lasting solutions for all of the components of the armed forces.\u201d   A similar uprising took place in November 2014, when thousands of soldiers left their barracks to demand back pay and benefits. At the time, the government agreed to meet the demands of the roughly 9,000 former rebel fighters, but those grievances have apparently endured.   A fractured military has threatened to undercut stability in Ivory Coast, as the government has  struggled  to effectively bring former rebels into the fold.   Bouak\u00e9 was a stronghold for rebels during a 2002 civil war that divided the country. A 2007 peace deal appointed a former rebel leader, Guillaume Soro, as prime minister, but the military remains a loosely knit national force.   Rebel fighters helped install Mr. Ouattara in 2011 after the president at the time, Laurent Gbagbo, refused to recognize Mr. Ouattara\u2019s electoral victory. When Mr. Gbagbo would not step down, it took an international military intervention to remove him.   The ensuing crisis left about 3,000 people dead. Mr. Gbagbo is  facing charges  at the International Criminal Court in The Hague relating to the violence.   Mr. Ouattara, an American-trained economist and a former top official at the International Monetary Fund, has promised to deliver inclusive economic growth. But threats to the country\u2019s stability such as the mutiny on Friday pose a stiff test for his economic goals.",

The black-smoke-spewing Admiral Kuznetsov has an air wing of just 15 planes, much smaller than Western fleet carriers, which have about 60, and it experienced  a number of problems  on the voyage.   Two of its 15 aircraft  crashed while trying to land  on the carrier. In both cases, the pilots ejected and survived. The remaining planes operated for a time from the Russian air base at Latakia, on land in western Syria, rather than from the carrier.   The mission was only the eighth long-distance voyage the mechanically troubled ship has undertaken since it was commissioned in 1990. During a military exercise in the Mediterranean in 1996, its distillation equipment broke down, leaving the crew of 2,000 short of potable water; the American Navy came to its aid.   On Friday, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff, ordered the Admiral Kuznetsov and several accompanying ships, including the missile cruiser Peter the Great, to return to their home port, Murmansk, in the Arctic, Russian news agencies reported. The general was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that the Kremlin was \u201cstarting to downsize the grouping of armed forces in Syria\u201d at the direction of President Vladimir V. Putin.   The drawdown order was the second since Russia\u2019s military operation began in Syria in September 2015. The first came last spring, and was followed by some well-publicized homecomings for Russian pilots, but it resulted in little real change in the Russian military\u2019s stance in Syria.   Mr. Putin ordered the latest drawdown after  a nationwide cease-fire  in Syria took effect on Dec. 30. The truce has  not halted all fighting  in the country, and it does not apply to actions against the Islamic State or other terrorist groups.   The carrier\u2019s return trip to Murmansk is expected to take about 10 days, the Russian military said.",

He has called the agreement \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated.\u201d At a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, he said, \u201cMy No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.\u201d Later, he said he would renegotiate the agreement.   Kerry:  The secretary said that the United States tried to reset relations with Russia early in President Obama\u2019s first term, but that a series of aggressions including \u201cunprecedented cyber intrusions,\u201d \u201cmilitary intervention in Syria,\u201d and the \u201cillegal occupation\u201d of Ukraine impeded that effort.   Trump:  Mr. Trump has made improved relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a cornerstone of his future foreign policy. After American intelligence agencies provided evidence that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee systems to help tip the election in his favor, Mr. Trump criticized the reliability of the intelligence community. He has praised Mr. Putin and said he would work closely with him to combat the Islamic State. Mr. Trump also seemed to upend American nuclear weapons policy when he declared in December: \u201cLet it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.\u201d   Kerry:  Mr. Kerry devoted a significant portion of his memo to climate change, calling it \u201cnot just a threat to the future of our planet, but a growing and immediate threat to our national security.\u201d He lauded an agreement struck between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, which bolstered a global climate agreement reached in  Paris in 2015  that he called the most \u201cambitious, inclusive climate agreement ever negotiated.\u201d   Trump:  Mr. Trump has called climate change a \u201choax,\" said he would \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris accords and vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cin almost every form.\u201d His nominee to run that agency is  Scott Pruitt , the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry, who has led the legal battle against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate-change policies.   Kerry:  Though the Obama administration never fulfilled a promise to shutter the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention center, Mr. Kerry wrote that \"no single action would do more to reaffirm our commitment to international human rights norms and remove a recruiting tool for terrorists than closing\u201d the site. During Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, the number of detainees decreased to 59 from 242, with 20 approved for transfer.   Trump:  In a message posted to  Twitter  on Tuesday, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cThere should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.\u201d   Kerry:  \u201cIt would be a moral failing of the highest caliber to turn our backs on those in need \u2014 including and especially from countries like Syria and Iraq,\u201d Mr. Kerry wrote, adding that the United States had a \u201cprofound responsibility to help refugees.\u201d   Trump:  After the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in December 2015, Mr. Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Later in the campaign, he said: \u201cWe must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.\u201d",

The bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing President Michel Temer, whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals, a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures.   \u201cThe bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs, a failed prison system and a weak government,\u201d said Rafael Alcadipani, a scholar who specializes in public security policies at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a leading Brazilian university. \u201cAnd now the horror is spreading.\u201d   Prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in Brazil. In 2006, street fighting between the police and First Capital Command, a prison-based gang, left almost 200 people dead in S\u00e3o Paulo,  causing chaos  in the city of 20 million people.   The killings in Roraima came just days after 56 men were killed in a  massacre at a prison in the city  of Manaus. In two different riots at prisons this week in the states of Amazonas and Para\u00edba, six men were also killed.   The violence at the Monte Cristo Agricultural Penitentiary in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, adds to fears about an  intensifying war  between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the Amazon region in Brazil.   The latest episode is thought to involve fighting between  First Capital Command , commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P.C.C., which has roots in the prisons of S\u00e3o Paulo in southeastern Brazil, and supporters of  Red Command , a drug trafficking organization that has long held sway in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities, however, tried to play down the possibility that warring gangs were to blame.   The gangs, which operate inside prisons as well as on the streets of many Brazilian cities, are battling for supremacy over the trade in cocaine smuggled into Brazil across the porous Amazonian frontier from countries like Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.   Family of the North, an increasingly influential gang in the Amazon that has allied itself with Red Command, was responsible for the attack at the prison in Manaus, massacring dozens of rivals from the P.C.C. gang. The attack had been planned for months, according to  text messages  intercepted by intelligence agents.   Mr. Temer, the president, has been chided for what some have called a  tone-deaf response  to the crisis. He said nothing for two days about the killings in Manaus, before calling them a \u201cdreadful accident\u201d and seeking to deflect blame from public agencies because a private contractor runs the prison there.   Just months after emerging victorious in the battle to impeach his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, Mr. Temer is grappling with calls from some of his own allies to resign. In an effort to defend himself, he sent a  message  Thursday on Twitter listing synonyms for the word \u201caccident\u201d \u2014 tragedy, loss, disaster, disgrace and misfortune.   Although the Manaus riot has  fueled a debate  over whether management of some prisons should be handed to private companies, the violence in Roraima casts scrutiny directly on state officials. The Boa Vista prison, which is run by the state, has  a long history  of deadly riots and inmate escapes.   The prison was built for 700 inmates but currently holds about 1,400. Carlos Paix\u00e3o de Oliveira, a prosecutor in Roraima, publicly criticized the management of the facility in October, when inmates from the P.C.C. gang killed at least 10 rivals from Red Command.   Mr. Oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced.   \u201cIf they want, the inmates will carry out a new slaughter in there, because no one has control of that prison,\u201d he said.   Despite the writing in blood on Friday proclaiming the supremacy of the P.C.C., the authorities contended that the latest killings did not involve score-settling between gangs but a power struggle within the P.C.C. itself, or an effort to project power by the gang.   \u201cWe\u2019ve been on guard about something like this for some time, transferring prisoners from Red Command to other units,\u201d said Uziel Castro, the top security official in Roraima. \u201cWe think this had to do with an internal battle.\u201d   Either way, the scenes from the Roraima penitentiary offered an unsettling reminder of how the bloodshed in the country\u2019s prisons is a problem that has been  building for decades , revealing a system hobbled by corruption, overcrowding and mismanagement.   Human rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the Carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in S\u00e3o Paulo, when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings.   The problems in Brazil\u2019s prisons that led to earlier episodes of carnage have intensified with the growing drug trade, security experts say. Brazil\u2019s prison population has swelled this century as the authorities lock up more people on minor drug offenses.   Brazil now has a prison population exceeding half a million, with about 40 percent of detainees  awaiting trial . Drug gangs that originated in prisons are expanding their sway and battling one another for territorial control of the trade.   \u201cThis war between the criminal factions is worsening,\u201d said Antonio Cl\u00e1udio Mariz de Oliveira, a former security official in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe problem is largely a result of the lack of attention towards the prison system, both by the government and the public.\u201d   \u201cPeople only react when there\u2019s an episode like this,\u201d said Mr. Mariz de Oliveira. \u201cThen they forget about it until the next one.\u201d   Indeed, some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by crime-weary voters. Jos\u00e9 Melo, the governor of Amazonas State, said \u201cthere were no saints\u201d among the dozens of inmates killed in the state\u2019s prisons this week, calling the victims murderers, rapists or gang members.   At the same time, officials in Mr. Temer\u2019s administration have tried to play down the prison crisis. \u201cThe situation is not out of control,\u201d said Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes.",

Lawmakers are permitted to make objections to both individual and state tallies, but they must be submitted in writing and signed by at least one member of both the House and the Senate. No senator chose to join the cause of the half-dozen or so House Democrats who raised complaints.   The result was a parade of clipped protests from House members, drowned out quickly by the questioning of the vice president, who also serves as the president of the Senate.   The members spoke of voter suppression, of Russian interference and of the bracing fear consuming many Americans.   \u201cMr. President, I object because people are horrified,\u201d began Representative Barbara Lee of California.   Repeatedly, Mr. Biden asked if anyone could produce an objection that was joined by a senator.   \u201cIn that case,\u201d he said, to Republican applause, when no one could, \u201cthe objection cannot be entertained.\u201d   As the exercise neared its end, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, stepped forward. \u201cI do not wish to debate,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish to ask: Is there one United States senator who will join me?\u201d   Mr. Biden reached for his gavel.   For Republicans, the state-by-state recap supplied a heartening reminder of November\u2019s great surprises: victories for Mr. Trump in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.   When the results in Colorado, a rare swing state victory for Hillary Clinton, were read aloud, a faint voice could be heard from the Democratic side: \u201cYea, Colorado.\u201d   But as Mr. Biden read the final numbers \u2014 including a single vote from an elector in Washington State for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American tribal leader who has led opposition to the  Keystone XL  pipeline \u2014 more conspicuous demonstrations against Mr. Trump erupted among visitors to the gallery   \u201cI rise to defend our democracy. We reject this electoral vote,\u201d one woman shouted as she was escorted out.   \u201cI rise to defend free and fair elections,\u201d a man cried a moment later. \u201cDonald Trump as commander in chief is a threat to American democracy.\u201d   A spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police said two men and one woman had been arrested.",

   "7. content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As congressional Republicans on Friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year\u2019s spending bills, President-elect  Donald J. Trump  insisted that  Mexico  would ultimately pay for its construction.   \u201cWe\u2019re going to get reimbursed,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed.\u201d   The congressional Republicans\u2019 talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. Mr. Trump insisted he is not.   Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars.   Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration.   In the interview, Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States. He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government.   \u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of everything,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall. \u201cWe are going to be making a much better deal. It\u2019s a deal that never should have been signed.\u201d   But he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall \u201cin order to speed up the process.\u201d   The full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous. Attaching such a charged issue to annual, mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight. Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government.   The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6.5 million per mile to build a single-layer fence, with an additional $4.2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico.   \u201cThe chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee\u2019s new chairman.   If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed.   Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border.   \u201cIf and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,\u201d she said in an email on Friday.   At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico,  Mr. Trump vowed that America\u2019s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden  of securing the border.   \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, believe me \u2014 100 percent \u2014 they don\u2019t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall.\u201d   In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall.   \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d  he wrote  early Friday .   Vicente Fox, who was Mexico\u2019s president from 2000 until 2006, responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own. In one of them, he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about Russian meddling in the 2016 election.   \u201cSr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating,\u201d  Mr. Fox said . \u201cLosing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?\u201d   Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it.   In an appearance on the CNN program \u201cNew Day,\u201d Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. \u201cOf course, we have to pay the bills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the wall.\u201d   As a candidate, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States.   His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall \u2014 that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars.   Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project.   \u201cIf President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U.S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N.I.H. to find cures for cancer,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.   Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall.   \u201cI think that\u2019s a heavy sell,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a tough sell for them.\u201d",

Trump has said about his energy strategy \u2014 he favors coal and wants to end federal subsidies to the clean energy industry \u2014 does it still make sense to invest in wind, solar and other alternative sources of power?   The answer is an emphatic yes, according to  investment advisers , who say clean energy companies will continue to thrive during a Trump administration, regardless of what the president says or does. The sector has become as much about getting returns on investments and catching the next technological boom as it is about reducing greenhouse gases and helping the environment.   And clean energy is creating jobs in every state, not just the ones that have oil or gas in the ground. Even the most politically conservative states, like Kansas and Iowa, are leaders in wind power and are likely to continue investing in it.   \u201cNo longer is there a trade-off between what you believe in and what you can make money off of,\u201d said Nancy Pfund, a founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, which made early investments in SolarCity and Tesla.   She predicts that investors \u201care going to redouble their efforts to migrate their portfolios to a 21st-century energy economy.\u201d Even without subsidies, she said, alternative energy sources will be well positioned to compete with coal and other carbon spewers.   \u201cIt really has to do with the cost of wind, solar and  electric cars  compared to where we were 12 years ago,\u201d Ms. Pfund said.   And there is momentum in the sector. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder,  recently announced a billion-dollar investment fund  to put money into energy research and the reduction of carbon emissions.   But the challenge for all investors during the Trump administration and beyond will be to make sure that passions for change and innovation, or anger at environmental policies that favor fossil fuels, do not cloud sound investment analysis.   \u201cRecently, people have taken the green mandate and said, \u2018You need to invest in the future,\u2019\u201d said Chat Reynders, the chief executive and chairman of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, a $1.3 billion asset-management firm. \u201cPeople have chased some investments that weren\u2019t timely or were not quality investments in order to participate.\u201d   For example, back in the 1970s, some investors were eager to back manufacturers of solar panels. But what was then a cutting-edge technology with high barriers to entry is now a commodity, with prices dropping as more manufacturers enter the market. This is good for the consumer, but not great for investors in the panel makers.   And  solar power  has very much gone mainstream.   Walmart , which has panels atop its stores as it works toward 100 percent renewable energy use, and other companies have become huge producers and consumers of solar energy.   \u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the economics driving solar, wind and battery storage,\u201d said Thomas Van Dyck, managing director in the SRI Wealth Management Group at RBC Wealth Management.   \u201cThe economics are such that in California, wind and solar are the cheapest form of power you can put in place,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor, you need to look at these long-term trends.\u201d   Despite the economic forces lining up behind clean energy, investors and analysts caution that people interested in investing in this area should be prepared for a rough ride in the short term.   \u201cIf you\u2019re a long-term investor and looking out five to 10 years, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Van Dyck said. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking at Intel or Microsoft in the 1990s \u2014 they had some cyclical issues, but look at them today.\u201d   An often-cited cautionary tale of passion trumping economic reasoning is  Solyndra,  the solar panel maker best known for spending $527 million in government loans before collapsing.   R. Paul Herman, the chief executive of HIP Investor, an investment rater and portfolio manager, said investors looking for broad guidance should keep three things in mind. They should look for companies that are trying to save money and reduce risk through clean energy. This is the Walmart example.   They should monitor their investments in fossil-fuel producers closely, lest their stocks plummet again as renewable energy gets cheaper and the value of their reserves diminishes. And those with a longer-term investment horizon and a higher tolerance for risk should look for companies focused on energy innovations.   The last is the holy grail. Ms. Pfund\u2019s firm, DBL Partners, had great success investing in Tesla and SolarCity, but she said she was not looking to mimic those investments today.   \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do is keep investing in the same old, same old,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture-backed electric car company was a smart investment 10 years ago, but today it\u2019s things like storage \u2014 the batteries in a Tesla or stationary storage \u2014 that are going to play a huge role in the electric grid of the future.\u201d   With storage, the energy created by the sun and wind can be used on demand \u2014 or on cloudy, calm days.   Mr. Reynders said he was steering clear of solar panels but liked companies that install the panels. He also said he thought the Trump administration would be good for alternative-energy investment, though not as its cheerleader. If the administration follows through on Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut clean-energy subsidies, it could force a shakeout in the industry and prompt investors to pay closer attention to company fundamentals.   For investors with a greater appetite for risk, there are certainly longer-term energy investments. One is graphene, a superthin, incredibly strong material that can be used as a conductor. Its promise is for batteries of the future, and probably much more.   William Page, portfolio manager for global environmental opportunities strategy at Essex Investment Management, said he saw the potential in investing in graphene but was avoiding it for now.   \u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a technology that might work in the lab today but it\u2019s not something that is a viable investment today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something that is profitable today.\u201d   Like Mr. Reynders, Mr. Page thinks that companies that install solar panels are a good investment. He also likes LED lighting installation \u2014 not the exactly the sexiest clean energy investment, but one that is environmentally sound and profitable today.   At the opposite end of the risk spectrum, Matthew Weatherley-White, co-founder and managing director at the Caprock Group, said people could make alternative energy investments in themselves, as it were.   \u201cSay you have $10,000,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to invest in a solar panel company or in a solar array for your house?\u201d   Of course, it depends on whether you are a city or country dweller. \u201cIn Idaho, where I live, there\u2019s 6 percent internal rate of return for a solar array, so you get paid back in 18 years,\u201d Mr. Weatherley-White said. \u201cThat might not blow the socks off as an investment, but it\u2019s pretty predictable.\u201d   In places like California, where state policies favor solar power, that rate of return could be three to four times what it is in Idaho, he said. Still, it comes down to a question every investor should ask: \u201cWhere am I going to invest for a positive financial return and an environmental impact?\u201d   And in the United States, it is the states rather than the federal government that may wield the greatest influence over the clean-energy sector. \u201cWhile the Trump victory for some was disturbing or took the wind out of their sails,\u201d Ms. Pfund said, \u201cthe federal government can only do so much.\u201d",

   "7. content": "PARIS \u2014 A panel of French judges has decided not to bring charges against soldiers accused of having sexually abused children while on a peacekeeping mission in the  Central African Republic , officials said on Friday.   Soldiers were sent to the country, a former French colony, in 2013 to help quell a sectarian conflict there, but allegations of sexual and physical violence by the troops have been an embarrassment for  France .   They also have been an embarrassment for the  United Nations , where rights investigators compiled a confidential report in 2014 about the allegations and the organization did not move quickly to rectify them. The French authorities became aware of the allegations only when the report was leaked to them.   The lapse at the United Nations in promptly notifying the French led to  an investigation by an independent panel  that accused some of the organization\u2019s officials of having passed the allegations \u201cfrom desk to desk, inbox to inbox\u201d and having failed to meet their core mission to protect the rights of the most vulnerable civilians.   The confidential report chronicled testimony by six children \u2014 ages 9 to 13 \u2014 who described abuse by the soldiers in a camp at Bangui M\u2019Poko International Airport in the capital from December 2013 to June 2014. Four of the children said they had been abused by the soldiers, while two said they had witnessed the abuse.   Acting on the report, French prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation in July 2014. The case was not known to the public until an advocacy group, AIDS Free World,  provided a copy to   the British newspaper The Guardian , which reported the findings in April 2015.   A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office, Agn\u00e8s Thibault-Lecuivre, said on Friday that the judges completed their review of the abuse allegations on Dec. 20. The decision to close the case, or bring it to trial, will be definitively made in less than four months, after the judges have received any additional information from groups representing the accusers and the prosecutor\u2019s office.   \u201cThere\u2019s a whole problem about identifying people,\u201d she said in a phone interview, noting that the case was particularly difficult because it was based solely on the children\u2019s accounts, without independent evidence. \u201cAre these accusations clear, accurate, detailed, repeated? And, based on these accusations, have we identified who might be the perpetrators?\u201d   The completion of the investigation was first reported by the radio network RFI and the newspaper Le Monde.   Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS Free World, reacted angrily to the news. \u201cThis is a travesty,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIf African soldiers had sexually abused little boys in Paris, the investigation wouldn\u2019t be closed until every perpetrator was behind bars.\u201d   Ms. Donovan also pointed out that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France had  vowed publicly to \u201cshow no mercy\u201d  to perpetrators of the abuse after it had become known.   Emmanuel Daoud, a lawyer for  Ecpat , an organization that combats the sexual exploitation of children, said in a phone interview that he was not surprised that criminal charges would not be brought. The organization has filed a civil claim seeking financial compensation for wrongdoing it says it believes was committed by the peacekeepers.   \u201cNeither the judges nor the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office has required that anyone be charged,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ll take a look and see if we agree with the judges and the prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201d   El\u00e9onore Chiossone, a technical expert at Ecpat, said the group was considering whether to keep looking for evidence, which it might present to the judges.   \u201cWe know how difficult it can be to collect testimony from children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy for children to be comfortable with that procedure.\u201d   St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations, said in a statement that it was following the developments in France \u201cwith interest\u201d and that member states have the responsibility \u201cto fully investigate and hopefully prosecute these crimes.\u201d   Mr. Dujarric also noted in the statement that the French troops were not part of the United Nations peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic \u201cand were not under U.N. command.\u201d   Ms. Thibault-Lecuivre said that the authorities on Nov. 20 closed a second investigation, involving the alleged abuse of a teenager by a French soldier in Boda, west of Bangui, in 2014. The teenager had initially accused the soldier of raping and impregnating her, but later changed her account and said they had unprotected but consensual sex,  according to  the French news site Mediapart.   The cases have been controversial. A draft of a United Nations memo in October suggested that some cases of sexual abuse in the Central African Republic might have been fabricated by people seeking to profit by making false accusations.   At least one other case of abuse involving French peacekeepers in the country \u2014 one concerning  allegations  that peacekeepers forced four girls in a displaced persons camp to have sex with a dog \u2014 remains under investigation. Last year, the United Nations referred the case for an investigation by the French Defense Ministry.",

She was 51.   The cause was a subarachnoid hemorrhage, her family said  in a statement .   Ms. Saward was 21 when members of an armed gang broke into the West London vicarage used by her father, an Anglican priest, and her family. Attackers dragged her upstairs and repeatedly raped her, while another man burglarized the house. Her father and her boyfriend were severely beaten.   Although the rapists were convicted, the case drew criticism after they received substantially shorter prison sentences than the man who had carried out the burglary.   John Leonard, the judge who sentenced the men, was quoted as saying that the rapists should be shown leniency because \u201cthe trauma suffered by the victim was not so great,\u201d according to news accounts at the time. He later expressed regret for the comment.   There was also public criticism of the way the news media covered the trial, publishing details that allowed Ms. Saward to be identified easily.   Ms. Saward\u2019s case led to changes in attitudes toward rape victims and important legal overhauls in  Britain . Victims of sexual assault were given the right to appeal lenient sentences given to their attackers, and the news media was blocked from identifying a rape victim before a defendant was charged.   In 1990, Ms. Saward became the first person in Britain to waive her right to anonymity as a victim of rape. With Wendy Green, she wrote a book, \u201cRape: My Story,\u201d in which she spoke openly about her trauma, how it had led to suicidal thoughts and how she had overcome them.   \u201cI believe forgiveness gives you freedom,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFreedom to move on without being held back by the past.\u201d   Ms. Saward went on to give training to judges and police officers on how to treat rape victims.   In 2013,  new guidelines  were published on how sex offenders in England and Wales would be punished, placing greater emphasis on treatment of victims, which had been a crucial part of Ms. Saward\u2019s campaign.   Reacting to the news, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury,  called Ms. Saward  a \u201cheroic and remarkable campaigner for the victims of rape.\u201d   She was born in Liverpool, England, on Jan. 14, 1965. She is survived by her husband, Gavin Drake; three sons; and a brother, Joe.   Ms. Saward wanted to be an organ donor after death, her family said, adding, \u201cIt gives us great comfort to know that our wonderful wife, mother and sister was able to help other people to the very end.\u201d",

One of the men grabs her and tries to force her on to the scooter, but she resists. The man throws her to the ground, and he and his companion ride away.   The video surfaced after news reports of \u201cmass molestation\u201d on two main roads in Bangalore during New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations \u2014 reports that the police said they could find no evidence of in security camera footage. The reports spurred widespread public outrage, which the police denials have done little to dispel.   The scooter assault, which happened in a different part of the city, first came to light on Wednesday, and by Thursday the police had arrested four suspects in the case. \u201cWe did not wait \u2014 we did not waste our time,\u201d the city\u2019s police commissioner, Praveen Sood, told reporters. \u201cWhat had been shown on the video convinced us beyond all possible doubt that this was a heinous crime.\u201d   Mr. Sood said the men in the video had been stalking the woman for at least four days, suggesting that the assault was unconnected to the apparently spontaneous hooliganism reported on New Year\u2019s Eve. He said the police were seeking two more men in the case.   There has been considerable public outcry over the news media reports of crowds of men harassing and groping women on the streets of Bangalore during the holiday. Photographs of the police and the crowds have circulated, including one showing a woman clinging to a female police officer. The reports have been viewed as the latest signs of a pervasive problem in India with the safety of women in public.   Some officials, including G. Parameshwara, the home minister of Karnataka State, have stirred up the issue further with comments  blaming women who dress and behave in \u201cWestern\u201d ways for provoking the harassment . Mr. Parameshwara  told reporters  on Friday that his remarks had been taken out of context.   Mr. Sood, the police commissioner, reiterated in a telephone interview on Friday that the police had reviewed security camera footage from the two main roads in central Bangalore and could find no evidence of the \u201cmass molestation\u201d reported by the news media.   \u201cOn the night of Dec. 31, nothing happened,\u201d Mr. Sood said. \u201cThe entire police force was there. I saw the unedited version, and I see nothing like molestation.\u201d   Even so, several women have said in television and newspaper interviews that they saw women molested in the crowd that night.   Based on the accounts in the news and on social media, the police have formally opened four criminal cases under a law that prohibits attacking a woman \u201cwith intent to outrage her modesty,\u201d according to Hemant Nimbalkar, a police official in Bangalore.   \u201cNow we are requesting media houses and people on social media to provide us with other footage or accounts they may have of these cases, and at the same time trying to track down the victims,\u201d Mr. Nimbalkar said.   Though the events themselves remain unclear, the controversy over what happened in Bangalore on New Year\u2019s Eve reflects a wider conflict in India\u2019s rapidly modernizing cities over the attitudes and mores of young people and youth culture.   Mr. Sood said it was evident in the security footage from Dec. 31 that \u201cmost of the boys and girls are totally intoxicated \u2014 their demeanor shows this.\u201d   Neither the police announcements nor the remarks of Mr. Parameshwara, the state home minister, seemed on Friday to have assuaged public anger. In a  video posted to Twitter , the cricket player Virat Kohli, who is based in Bangalore, called the events on New Year\u2019s Eve in Bangalore \u201creally, really disturbing.\u201d   \u201cFor men to accept that it\u2019s an opportunity to do something like this and get away with it, and people in power trying to defend it, it\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u201d he said.",

Senator Durbin calls it \u201csurreal.\u201d   \u201cI spent months never believing that he would be elected president,\u201d Senator Durbin says from his office in Capitol Hill, where he can see workers constructing the stage for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.   \u201cI sincerely hope that the office makes the man,\u201d Senator Durbin adds.

Mr. Mucha \u2014 along with local art restorers, conservators and historians \u2014 passionately opposes the city\u2019s plan to take his grandfather\u2019s masterwork \u201cSlav Epic\u201d on tour internationally for the first time.   \u201c Slav Epic \u201d is a cycle of 20 large canvases shown since 2012 at the  Veletrzni Palace , part of the  National Gallery  here, depicting the mythology and history of Czech and other Slavic peoples. Completed in 1928, it was given to Prague by Alphonse Mucha over the 18 years it took to create. Today, the works are strongly linked to Czech identity, having survived near-destruction during  World War II  and under communism.   Last month, the  Prague City  Gallery , caretaker of the works, announced that the city had signed off on a three-month loan to the  National Art Center,  Tokyo , starting in March, as part of the center\u2019s year of Czech culture. With individual pieces of \u201cSlav Epic\u201d standing well over 20 feet, experts have said that the works are simply too big to move internationally without damaging them.   For Mr. Mucha, this is too much of a risk to take. He also says it is a violation of a 1913 agreement between the artist and his benefactor, the American philanthropist Charles R. Crane, who financed the creation of \u201cSlav Epic.\u201d The agreement stipulates that the works be donated to Prague on the condition that the city build a permanent facility to house them \u2014 a promise that, nearly 90 years after the cycle\u2019s completion, has not been kept.   For this reason, Mr. Mucha said, he is asking the courts \u201cto confirm that the deed of gift was not done,\u201d and that it is invalid. In a lawsuit filed in his name against the city of Prague, he is asking that ownership of the works be transferred back to the Mucha estate. Court hearings are set to begin Jan. 18.   Alphonse Mucha, who lived from 1860 to 1939, rose to fame in Paris as a designer of advertising posters in the 1890s before going on to create a range of illustrations and paintings in an ornate style synonymous with Art Nouveau. (In the 1960s, Mucha\u2019s influence was revived in psychedelic posters from San Francisco\u2019s rock scene.)   But \u201cSlav Epic\u201d is widely seen as Mucha\u2019s masterpiece, and its insurance value is at least 10.8 million euros, or roughly $11 million at current exchange rates, the Czech news media reported in September.   \u201cHe is referred to as kind of a godlike figure,\u201d said Gabriel Weisberg, a professor of art history at the University of Minnesota, adding that Mucha contributed to the revitalization of the color print revolution during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.   Prof. Karel Stretti, who leads the restoration department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, said the largest of the \u201cSlav Epic\u201d pieces measures 26.5 feet by 20 feet, meaning handlers would have to remove it from its frame and roll it up, which could crack the paint.   \u201cThe nature of the works \u2014 egg tempera on a hemp canvas \u2014 and the way it may be insulated makes them particularly vulnerable,\u201d the professor added.   In 1921, five canvases were sent to New York and Chicago at the behest of Mr. Crane. The works returned with minor blemishes and the city of Prague advised in 1936 that they were not be moved again, according to letters Professor Stretti showed to The New York Times.   During World War II, the \u201cSlav Epic\u201d paintings were nearly lost forever. Mucha was interrogated by the Gestapo, accused of being a nationalist and a Jewish sympathizer, shortly before his death from pneumonia in 1939. The canvases were then rolled up and hidden in a local school to keep them out of the hands of the Nazis. They would not be seen again until the 1960s, when they were exhibited in a castle near where Mucha was born. They were moved to Veletrzni Palace in 2012.   According to Professor Stretti, who leads an association of restorers, 600 people have signed a petition calling for Prague to cancel the Tokyo loan. Restorers, conservators and local experts have accused the Prague government of not appreciating the risks of a relocation, and of being blinded by the typical financial incentives in such loans.   \u201cPolitical and economic interests should not be placed ahead of the interests of our culture,\u201d the professor said.   Neither the city of Prague nor the National Art Center in Tokyo responded to inquiries about how much the center would pay for the loan.   Jan Wolf, Prague\u2019s councilor in charge of culture, who is responsible for the loan, declined requests for an interview.   The Prague City Gallery, which is controlled by the City Council, has sought to reaffirm its decision to lend the paintings, saying in an emailed statement last month that Mucha had wanted \u201cto show the importance of Slavic history to the widest possible audience, not only in Europe but also overseas.\u201d   The city maintains that, in any case, it is not contractually obligated to build a venue for \u201cSlav Epic,\u201d Jana Felixova, a lawyer representing Prague in the forthcoming trial, said by email. She said that John Mucha\u2019s case hinged on the 1913 agreement between his grandfather and Mr. Crane.   The document, a scanned copy of which was seen by The New York Times, states that the city agreed in 1909 to build a place to house \u201cSlav Epic.\u201d While the city recognizes the document as authentic, Ms. Felixova said, it is not bound by it because Prague is not a signatory.   Despite the pending court hearings, the gallery plans to move ahead with its project: It says the 20 canvases that make up the \u201cSlav Epic\u201d will be rolled up in the next two weeks and be sent to Japan in time for the exhibition.   \u201cPrague accepted the ownership of the \u2018Slav Epic\u2019 in good faith and was, and still is, convinced of the indisputability of its ownership,\u201d Ms. Felixova said.",

Other steps include terminating planned Trump Organization projects in countries like Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia and Georgia.   In addition to removing his name from his charitable foundation, Mr. Trump will no longer personally solicit funds for it, he said in several interviews with The New York Times.  To further avoid conflicts , Mr. Trump said in an email this week, his sister-in-law and a Trump Organization executive will step down from the foundation\u2019s executive committee.   The Trump Organization will continue to raise money for St. Jude from patrons at its hotels and golf courses, Mr. Trump said. But it will ask them to make contributions directly to the hospital, he said, instead of first sending the money to the Trump Organization.   The St. Jude letter said that since its establishment, the Eric Trump Foundation had raised \u2014 or helped raise through affiliated groups \u2014 $16.3 million for the hospital, which offers free care to needy children.   Tax documents filed by nonprofit foundations are often delayed by two years, so there is no public accounting of these totals yet available. The letter said that some of the money was raised via related efforts, such as an Eric Trump Foundation-affiliated team that participates in the New York City Marathon.   \u201cI am amazed by the many ways that you have personally embraced our cause and cared for our children and families,\u201d Richard C. Shadyac Jr., president of the hospital\u2019s fund-raising organization, wrote in the Dec. 30 letter, which Mr. Trump provided to The Times. \u201cAs you are aware, we are expanding our lifesaving work and are working to push cure rates even higher in this country and around the world, while improving the lives of survivors by developing and advancing treatments that reduce side effects. We are only able to do this because of the support provided by donors and supporters like you.\u201d   In his email this week, Mr. Trump said he would \u201ccontinue to be a vocal advocate for pediatric cancer and St. Jude\u2019s mission.\u201d   President-elect Donald J. Trump has  announced that he is shutting down  his own personal foundation, although it is currently the target of an investigation by the New York State attorney general over accusations that it did not have the  proper permit to solicit contributions , and that it may have used money to benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s own interests. No such accusations have been made about Eric Trump\u2019s foundation.",

But on Friday, a spokesman for the Taliban denied they were behind the attack, saying the area where it took place was not under their control. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any connection with the incident in Baghlan Province; we are sad for those who lost their lives,\u201d said the spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid.   While most accounts put the number dead at nine, different officials and local elders put the figure anywhere from seven to 13 people.   Arbab Muhammed Rasoul, an elder in Barfak village who went to help collect the bodies, said two gunmen on a motorcycle stopped the bus and forced off all of the passengers, who were 25 to 40 years old, before opening fire on them.   \u201cWe put all the dead bodies in a room in Barfak village and will send them to Daykondi tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rasoul said.   Chaman Ali, a relative of one of the workers killed in the attack, said three people survived by jumping into a river. \u201cThey had just received their salaries and they were happy because they were heading home,\u201d Mr. Ali said.   Mine workers in Tala Wa Barfak make about $10 a day, relatives said.   Some of the local officials suspected that Islamic State affiliates, who have claimed responsibility for  other deadly attacks against Hazaras , were behind the killings. Samiuddin Nazer, a member of Baghlan\u2019s provincial council, said officials had received reports of an Islamic State presence in Tala Wa Barfak about six months ago.   But Gen. Noor Habib Gulbahari, the province\u2019s police chief, played down such suggestions.   \u201cSome people were saying that the attackers were I.S. members, but we did not have any intelligence about the presence of I.S. in Baghlan before this,\u201d General Gulbahari said.",

   "7. content": "Every public housing complex in America is filled with individual tales of struggle and survival. This is the story of a dapper man in a black fedora who lives in unit 16G in the Bronx.   His name is Souleymane Guengueng, and he brought down a murderous African dictator.   In the 1980s, Mr. Guengueng was one of numerous people  imprisoned and tortured  during the brutal reign of President Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 in  Chad , a landlocked country in central Africa. When he was released from prison after two and a half years, Mr. Guengueng began a quest for justice, meticulously recording the testimonies of survivors and the relatives of those who had been killed at the direction of Mr. Habr\u00e9. He wound up with records detailing the abuse and murder of more than 700 people.   Human rights advocates collected his accounts and used them as critical pieces of evidence to pursue criminal action against Mr. Habr\u00e9. The legal case was not an easy one. Finding a court to prosecute a head of state proved difficult. For more than 16 years, the case bounced between nations and continents, with Mr. Guengueng offering his personal plea for justice to anyone who would listen.   In May, in Dakar, Senegal, where Mr. Habr\u00e9 had lived in exile,  the dictator was finally convicted . Next week, a court there will hear his appeal.   On the day of the guilty verdict, a defiant Mr. Habr\u00e9, wearing dark glasses and with his head wrapped in white scarves as though he were bracing for a desert storm, raised his fists and yelled to supporters in the courtroom.   Mr. Guengueng was in the courtroom, too, his trademark hat on the seat beside him, flanked by human rights advocates who had pursued justice against other dictators. He had been a key witness in the trial. Tears spilled from his eyes, a mix of pride and revenge and sadness and relief.   \u201cIt was like an out-of-body experience for me,\u201d Mr. Guengueng, 67, said. \u201cHabr\u00e9 is in prison now. Habr\u00e9 must be saying, \u2018Look at me now, he\u2019s in this place and I\u2019m in prison.\u2019 \u201d   For Mr. Guengueng, \u201cthis place\u201d is a tidy, three-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, one of 160 apartments in a towering public housing complex on a busy, nondescript New York City street.   In the human rights world, Mr. Guengueng is a celebrity, sometimes even stopped on the street by people who recognize him when he travels across the globe. In New York, he is another face in the crowd.   Mr. Guengueng first came to the United States in 2002 from his mud-brick home in Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, to accept a human rights award. He met the actor Samuel L. Jackson, cruised California\u2019s State Route 1 along the Pacific coast in a convertible and detoured to check out Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif. (\u201cTr\u00e8s chic!\u201d he said, eyebrows raised.)   He returned to Chad, where most people live on less than $5 a day, to his job as an accountant at the Lake Chad Basin Commission, a multinational group that manages resources around the lake. His vocal activism in pursuing legal action against Mr. Habr\u00e9 was wearing on the commission, Mr. Guengueng said, and he lost his job.   Mr. Guengueng blames his work with the commission for getting him into trouble with Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s government in the first place. At one point during Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s presidency, the commission had moved its headquarters to nearby Cameroon, and Mr. Guengueng presumes that Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s supporters passing through must have labeled the civil servants there political enemies.   In 2005, while living in Chad, Mr. Guengueng had a tear in his retina. He had long worn Coke-bottle glasses because of vision problems, and he said he suspected his time in prison had aggravated his condition.   Reed Brody, a former  Human Rights Watch  lawyer who doggedly pursued the case against Mr. Habr\u00e9, arranged for Mr. Guengueng to fly to New York for medical care. He recovered in Mr. Brody\u2019s apartment in Brooklyn, taking long walks in Prospect Park.   While his eyes were healing he started hearing from friends and family members that his life might be at risk if he returned home. Mr. Habr\u00e9 was ousted in a 1990 coup, but he still had many supporters in Chad.   With the help of Human Rights Watch, Mr. Guengueng successfully applied for asylum in America. Soon, he brought his wife and seven children to New York.   Then financial troubles and bad luck set in. Mr. Guengueng was on the Human Rights Watch payroll, working on the criminal case from New York. But that work ran out.   He was hired as a night watchman. But in 2007 during a stroll on the Coney Island Boardwalk, he fell and broke his leg. His recovery was long, and he lost his job.   His oldest daughter supported the family with a restaurant job. But she became ill and died, leaving the family with little income.   Home life was tense. Mr. Guengueng is trilingual, but English has been difficult. Taking classes has not helped. In New York, his wife felt as if she had lost her independence living in an unfamiliar place where she did not speak the language. And New York was cold. In Chad, afternoon temperatures rarely dipped below 90 degrees.   Mr. Guengueng did not give up. He and some friends pooled their resources to buy a deli but lost the money when the deal fell apart. He enrolled in a course to learn medical coding and billing but could not find a job in that field. He tried driving a taxi but the work aggravated his leg, which has never been the same since the break. His wife took a babysitting course but had no space to care for children. Back in Chad, another daughter died in a fire.   Mr. Guengueng was interspersing his daily tribulations with work on the Habr\u00e9 case, flying with Mr. Brody to courts worldwide to personally plead for justice.   \u201cHe\u2019s a hero,\u201d Mr. Brody said. \u201cHe\u2019s done so much to change history. Yet his day-to-day life is one of hardships and heartbreaks.\u201d   The family moved from a friend\u2019s home on Long Island to a tiny rental in Queens. They could not keep up with the $2,000 a month rent and were evicted.   Three and a half years ago, Mr. Guengueng\u2019s family had to move into a homeless shelter, where they were crammed into two rooms. Determined to find something better, he practically memorized the intricacies of New York\u2019s housing laws as he searched for government-subsidized housing.   Finally, in March, the family left the shelter and moved into their current apartment in the Bronx. He lives there with three of his children; the others are now grown and have moved out. Most speak English, and one son, Jacob, 25, graduated from college and is an Uber driver.   On a recent afternoon at Mr. Guengueng\u2019s apartment, a film from Ivory Coast was on the television. Mr. Brody arrived to see his old friend. Mr. Guengueng insisted on pulling his dusty human rights awards and statuettes from his closet. He carefully fingered them like gemstones.   Mr. Guengueng will be in court next week for the appeal, but his long obsession with the case is finished.   \u201cIt\u2019s like a psychological healing has taken place,\u201d said Mr. Guengueng, whose face is marked by deep tribal scars. \u201cIf I had just allowed this situation to persist and had a normal life I would have felt incomplete. Like I was half a man.\u201d   The case also was all-consuming for Mr. Brody. He left his job with Human Rights Watch this past summer and has taken on volunteer legal work for now.   \u201cWe\u2019re both unemployed,\u201d Mr. Guengueng said, nudging Mr. Brody and laughing.   Despite the hardships in New York, Mr. Guengueng calls his time in America a success. His family has health care. His children have an education. He and most of his family have become American citizens. And Mr. Guengueng is thrilled with his new apartment.   \u201cWe\u2019re in paradise now,\u201d he said.   Mr. Guengueng, who says he is too old to find a good job, spends his days shuffling between municipal offices for food stamps and housing allowances. Every once in a while, the grind is broken by a black-tie dinner in Manhattan where he receives awards for his work.   He wants to create a foundation where he can advise other victims like himself, but he has yet to find a major donor. His own hardship is over.   \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI think about the others.\u201d",

   "7. content": "BEIJING \u2014 Like ghosts floating in a dim netherworld, the dancers twirled, spun and curtsied in smog so dense that couples a few steps away seemed to be murky apparitions suspended in a gray haze. Filthy air has swamped much of northern  China  for weeks, but some amateur dancers have stuck to their outdoor ballroom routines.   The specterlike dancers in Fuyang, a city in Anhui Province, this week have become one of the images that capture China\u2019s latest winter of smog. A wintertime surge in pollution here is often called an \u201cairpocalypse\u201d in foreign news reports. But as these images suggest, living in this miasma has become for many residents a  routine to be endured , even defied with an outdoor fox trot.   \u201cThe scariest thing isn\u2019t the smog, it\u2019s how we\u2019ve become numbed and used to it,\u201d said one  comment about the pictures  on a Chinese news website,  163.com . Others shrugged off the bleakness with sardonic humor, as people here often do.   \u201cThere\u2019s nothing scary,\u201d said another comment on the same website. \u201cBreathing fresh smog every day, I feel fortunate to be living in this magical country.\u201d   Air pollution is chronic across much of industrialized China, but it worsens in winter, when coal-burning heaters fire up and add to the airborne grunge from factories and power plants. An uptick in heavy industry in 2016 has added to the haze this winter, some experts say. In the cold months, polluted air can accumulate across the region, sloshing from one part to another until strong gusts blow it away \u2014 until another pool accumulates. Smog extended from the port city of Tianjin deep into central China on Thursday.   On Tuesday in Fuyang, the air quality there was poor, but not terrible by the hard-bitten standards of many Chinese cities. The level of PM2.5 pollution, the fine particulates that pose the greatest danger to health,  reached an average  283 micrograms per cubic meter, and the air was classified \u201cseverely polluted.\u201d   But since December, levels across many cities in northern China have gone much higher, even reaching 1,000 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter last month  in Shijiazhuang , a city in Hebei Province. The World Health Organization  recommends  daily exposure of no more than 25 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter.   Many residents have become increasingly sensitive to the health threats from air pollution. Patience with the smog is wearing thin, especially among middle-class residents, who can afford to travel and experience life and breathing outside the dome of haze.   The government has promised to clean up the air, and indeed there have been improvements, especially throughout the summer last year. Yet that progress has made the return of the smog this winter even more jarring. Travelers returning by air to Beijing lately have descended from blue skies onto a Stygian underworld. For those trying to leave, many flights have been delayed or cancelled on the worst days because of the poor visibility.   What worries many people most is the risk to children and the elderly. This week, a letter in the name of Beijing parents urged the city government to allow schools and parents to buy fresh air equipment for classrooms. Officials said air filters would be  installed in some schools  as a tryout, though not the bigger equipment the letter called for.   \u201cWe really don\u2019t want to wait any longer!\u201d said the letter, which circulated widely on the internet. \u201cThe smog won\u2019t wait for us.\u201d   Many people in Beijing and other affected Chinese cities now routinely wear masks \u2014 a novelty even a few years ago \u2014 although often they use cheap, flimsy cotton covers that do little to ward off PM2.5 particles.   \u201cThis winter was the first time I\u2019ve thought about moving away,\u201d said Lu Xin, a manager with an internet firm, breathing through a high-tech mask attached to its own electric air filter. \u201cMy 3-year-old boy and my parents cooped up at home every day, never going out. Is that a way to live?\u201d",

Now, that ingenuity is focused on one of the country\u2019s most intractable modern problems: Delhi\u2019s toxic air.   A dense blanket of smog descends over Delhi each autumn, pushing air pollution readings to nearly unbearable levels. And when an outpost of the  University of Chicago  in New Delhi held a competition for new ideas to solve the pollution problem, many of the entries drew on good old jugaad.   Some submissions were questionable, to say the least. One contestant proposed planting gardens on top of buses to create natural mobile air filters. Another resident suggested fitting automobile exhaust pipes with a device that could suck up pollution particles, but failed to explain how the technology would actually work.   Closer to the mark were ideas like vertical gardens, with walls of hydroponic greenery planted in the city\u2019s slums to absorb some of the pollution from open-air stoves and car exhaust. That one was a finalist. So was a suggestion to provide insulated kiosks for the guards who keep watch outside the gated houses of the wealthy, so the guards can stop burning garbage all night to keep warm.   In the end, the winners, announced in October, were plans that seemed to be the most sustainable and achievable. They included a machine that converts rice straw into fertilizer, so that farmers around the capital would no longer burn their fields after each harvest.   Another winning idea would capture some of the emissions from diesel generators and turn the soot particles into black ink and paint.   The chosen projects will be put into action this year as small pilot programs, but Anna Agarwal, a senior manager at the university\u2019s Energy and Environment Lab, said they could eventually be scaled up.",

The Bangladeshi authorities said Mr. Chowdhury planned the attack in July at  the restaurant, the  Holey Artisan Bakery . He was killed in August  in a shootout .   The police said the two men worked intensively with the team of five assailants who burst into the restaurant and singled out foreigners and non-Muslims inside. Twenty Bangladeshi and foreign hostages and two police officers were killed, the most ambitious attack undertaken by Islamist insurgents in the region in recent years.   The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack and celebrated Mr. Chowdhury and his team in promotional materials.   Mr. Marzan and Mr. Chowdhury, who were together on the night of the attack but not at the restaurant, spoke with the attackers three or four times during the siege, using telephones taken from victims or hostages, according to Monirul Islam, who leads the police counterterrorism unit in Dhaka, the capital.   The final conversation took place shortly before the five attackers left the restaurant and were killed by police gunfire, an indication of the role the trainers played in their lives, Mr. Islam said.   \u201cBefore death, if anyone knows they are going to die, he usually calls the nearest person,\u201d he said.   The police have also said that the attackers sent gory photographs from the restaurant to Mr. Marzan, who forwarded them to others. The photographs were swiftly distributed through Islamic State social media networks.   Relatives of Mr. Marzan, who was from northern Bangladesh,  told The Daily Star  of Dhaka that he was a student of Arabic at the University of Chittagong but that he had fallen out of contact with them in early 2016.   Since July, the police have located and eradicated 20 safe houses used by four or five terrorist cells that were a part of Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s network, Mr. Islam said. He said that 60 of the network\u2019s members had been killed or arrested, leaving only a handful at large.   Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s death was followed by a pause in attacks by militants in Bangladesh. Since 2013, assassinations and small-scale attacks had been taking place every few weeks, typically targeting foreigners or non-Muslims, including atheists.   On Dec. 24, a woman and man  detonated suicide vests during a police raid  on the outskirts of Dhaka. The police said it was the first time that a female terrorist had carried out a suicide bombing in Bangladesh.",

Overdose deaths were nearly equal to the number of deaths from car crashes. In 2015, for the first time, deaths from heroin alone  surpassed gun homicides .   And there\u2019s no sign it\u2019s letting up, a team of New York Times reporters found as they examined  the epidemic on the ground  in states across the country. From New England to \u201csafe injection\u201d areas in the Pacific Northwest, communities are searching for a way out of a problem that can feel inescapable.   Marblehead, Mass.   Katie Harvey walked out of the house where she lived with friends, shoved her duffel bag into her mother\u2019s car and burst into tears.   \u201cI need to go to detox,\u201d she told her mother, Maureen Cavanagh. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of everything.\u201d   Ms. Harvey, 24, had been shooting heroin for three years. She had been in and out of detox \u2014 eight times altogether. But it had always been someone else\u2019s idea.   This time, Ms. Harvey made the arrangements herself. She had come to loathe her life. \u201cI haven\u2019t even been doing enough to get really high,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just maintaining myself so I don\u2019t get sick.\u201d   Before she left for detox, Ms. Harvey curled up on the couch in her mother\u2019s living room in this well-to-do suburb north of Boston and reflected on her life: her low self-esteem despite model-worthy good looks; her many lies to her family; how she had pawned her mother\u2019s jewelry and had sex with strange men for money to pay for drugs.   As she spoke, tears spilled from her eyes. She wiped them with the cuff of her sweater, which covered track marks and a tattoo that said \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2014 her goal, to be unshackled from the prison of addiction.   Ms. Harvey had been a popular honors student. But she developed  anorexia . Alcohol was next. By 21, she was hooked on heroin.   In 2015, she was arrested on charges of prostitution. In an extraordinary act of contrition, she wrote  a public apology online  to her friends and family.   Still, she plunged in deeper. She estimated that at her worst, she was shooting up a staggering number of times a day, perhaps as many as 15 \u2014 heroin, cocaine, fentanyl. She overdosed five times. In Massachusetts, almost five residents die every day from overdoses.   \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m alive, honestly,\u201d Ms. Harvey said.   That night in October, she went into detox. Four days later, she checked out. She went back to her friends and drugs, developing an  abscess  on her arm, probably from dirty needles.   Two weeks later, she was back in detox. This time, she stayed, then entered a 30-day treatment program.   The return trips to detox have been an emotional roller coaster for her mother. To cope, Ms. Cavanagh founded a group,  Magnolia New Beginnings , to help drug users and their families.   Among her words of advice: Tell your children you love them, because \u201cit might be the last thing you say to them.\u201d   KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   Marshalltown, Iowa   Andrea Steen is one of the fortunate ones. For people in this rural community of 28,000, getting medication to help overcome opioid addiction used to require long drives to treatment centers.   That changed about a year ago when two doctors here were licensed to prescribe Suboxone, a drug that eases withdrawal symptoms and helps keep opioid cravings at bay. Now Ms. Steen is one of their patients, coming once a month to check in and renew her prescription.   This epidemic is different from those of the past in significant ways. One is that it has spawned a growing demand for medications that can help modify addiction\u2019s impact.   One of them is naloxone, known as Narcan, a powerful antidote that has jolted hundreds of overdosed users back to life. Another is buprenorphine, typically sold as Suboxone.   By keeping users from experiencing cravings and withdrawal, Suboxone can make it easier for addicts to stay off heroin and other opioids. The number of doctors certified to prescribe buprenorphine has more than doubled since 2011, to about 36,000 from about 16,000, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Yet the drug remains out of reach for many rural Americans.   Ms. Steen, 46, is among 20 patients who get Suboxone from the two doctors authorized to prescribe it here. Until last summer, she said, she abused Vicodin and morphine relentlessly. She would steal them from her disabled husband, who would try in vain to hide them. But sometimes she couldn\u2019t root out the pills fast enough, and she would experience what every addict dreads most: withdrawal.   She heard about Suboxone from a friend in Tennessee whom she met through Facebook.   \u201cShe could tell when I was high,\u201d Ms. Steen said. \u201cHer husband was on Suboxone. She was trying to help me.\u201d   Ms. Steen started on Suboxone in July, initially making weekly visits to Dr. Nicole Gastala and Dr. Timothy Swinton, the family practitioners here who prescribe the drug. Then it was every other week.   Unlike methadone, which also helps treat opioid addiction but must be taken under supervision at special clinics, Suboxone can be taken at home. Some doctors fail to follow Suboxone patients closely, or to test their urine to make sure they are not abusing or selling the medication or using other drugs. But the protocol here is strict.   Besides her doctor visits, Ms. Steen must attend group therapy and have regular urine tests.   She has mostly stopped craving opioids, for now.   ABBY GOODNOUGH   Los Angeles   They enter through an unmarked turquoise storefront, nestled between fashion boutiques on Melrose Avenue. They gather in a circle, ready for the tough-love approach they have come to expect from Howard C. Samuels, a clinical psychologist who runs the Hills, a drug rehabilitation center whose location is central to its marketing.   A spot in the room is hard to come by, as are most drug rehabilitation services, especially for the poor and anyone without the proper insurance. The Hills, which can cost around $50,000, serves a more privileged population, yet its mission is no less daunting.   In 2014,  heroin became the most common   reported drug of choice among those seeking treatment in Los Angeles County, surpassing marijuana and methamphetamine.   Dr. Samuels began with what he called a reality check. \u201cHow many of you have been to at least five treatment centers?\u201d he asked. Nearly every one of the 19 clients in the room raised a hand.   \u201cHow about 10?\u201d Still half of the clients raised their hands.   One of them, Jordan, who agreed to tell his story only if his last name was not disclosed, knows he is one of the lucky ones. This is only his third time in rehab, a relative rookie at 33 years old. This was his 118th day sober.   He had smoked pot, taken ecstasy and occasionally snorted cocaine. But heroin seemed off-limits to him, a college-educated son of two therapists, until a friend offered him some to smoke. Four years later, he blew through a $20,000 inheritance in a month to get what he called the best heroin in the city.   After his first days of detox were over at the Hills, Jordan began what would be months of therapy. He confronted what Dr. Samuels calls \u201ccharacter defects,\u201d and rattles his off easily: lust, anger, lack of discipline.   On this day, he knows he will draw the wrath of Dr. Samuels: Subverting the rules, he recently went out for his seventh tattoo. \u201cMy addiction has been replaced with addiction to other things: going to the gym, smoking, girls, getting tattoos.\u201d   \u201cDon\u2019t you owe me an apology?\u201d Dr. Samuels said to him, almost shouting.   Jordan answered quietly: \u201cYeah, I guess I owe you and some people an apology.\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re apologizing to me. That\u2019s good, but what\u2019s bad is, it came so naturally,\u201d Dr. Samuels said.   \u201cAll of us have some real impulse control problems,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re drug addicts.\u201d   JENNIFER MEDINA   Seattle   The girl looked to be barely out of her teens, and was teetering on the brink of consciousness.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t even form a sentence,\u201d said Dan Manus, a soft-spoken 61-year-old in a Seattle Seahawks cap. His jaw tightened as he recalled the night in October when he and his partner on the King County Emergency Service Patrol found the girl and, he thinks, saved her life.   A former addict, he knows the terrain too well. He\u2019s been clean for 22 years now, and working for the county for the last nine.   \u201cI can relate to everybody I work with down there, because for the grace of God, there go I,\u201d Mr. Manus said, standing in the patrol parking lot between runs. \u201cSo, yeah, I feel like this kind of was my calling.\u201d   The Emergency Service Patrol was established in the 1980s by a private charity (later taken over by King County) to rescue street alcoholics by bringing them to a safe \u201csobering center\u201d to sleep it off.   In October, though, in an acknowledgment of heroin\u2019s new ravages \u2014 treatment admissions for heroin in King County surpassed alcohol for the first time in 2015 \u2014 Mr. Manus and other patrol crew members were trained and equipped with naloxone.   \u201cHarm reduction\u201d is an approach that was to some degree pioneered here. One of the nation\u2019s first clean-needle exchanges started in nearby Tacoma in 1988.   King County is now considering opening what could be the country\u2019s first safe-injection site. There, addicts could use drugs under supervision by a health worker who may, crucially, also open the door to recovery programs, all under one roof.   For Mr. Manus, the crisis is personal. In 1992, he was saved from death by someone who found him in mid-overdose and called paramedics.   Seattle was a different, harder-edged city back then. Grunge music, and the heroin that swirled like a slipstream through the lives and song lyrics of some of its stars, was spilling out of the clubs.   The mix of drugs was changing, too.  Heroin\u2019s impact in King County surged in the late 1990s  in the number of times it was identified in connection with a drug death, before beginning a near decade-long slide \u2014 a period that coincided with an increase in the number of times prescription opioids were found in victims\u2019 bodies, which peaked in 2009. In that same year, heroin\u2019s role began rising again to hit its highest-ever, worst numbers in 2014 with a drop since then, according to county figures.   More people lately seem to be on complex combinations of drugs, Mr. Manus said \u2014 like the girl who, at his direction, was treated by paramedics.   \u201cIt just seems today that there\u2019s so much more out there, so many more people,\u201d Mr. Manus said quietly. \u201cIt feels nonstop.\u201d   KIRK JOHNSON   Nogales, Ariz.   A tipster warned: Look out for a silver Nissan Sentra approaching the busy Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry in Nogales, Ariz., a crucial gateway for cheap heroin made in Mexico.   Early one morning, the Nissan rolled into passport control. A Customs and Border Protection officer caught the telltale signs of a driver who had something to hide: the darting eyes, the tight grip on the steering wheel.   The driver carried a border-crossing card, an entry permission given only to Mexican citizens. He also carried his wife and two small children and a load of heavy drugs: four pounds of methamphetamine in the passenger\u2019s backrest, and seven and a half pounds of heroin between the engine and the dashboard.   Last year, Customs and Border Protection agents seized more than 930 pounds of heroin in Arizona, which is almost one-third of all heroin seized along the entire southern border. Agents acknowledge that they catch only a small fraction of what goes through.   Much of the heroin that enters this country comes hidden in cars, concealed in suitcases, squeezed inside hollowed fire extinguishers, or strapped to the thighs, crotches and chests of Mexicans and Americans who cross between the two countries.   To the special agents assigned to Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mules are the first link of a knotted chain that may or may not lead to the agents\u2019 ultimate prize: a top drug trafficker.   \u201cIt\u2019s about preventing the narcotics from entering the community,\u201d said Jesus Lozania, the agent in charge in Nogales. \u201cIt\u2019s taking down the organization from the bottom all the way to the top: the mules, the people who coordinate the logistics, the persons who handle the money after the narcotics are sold in the United States. That cash has to make its way back to Mexico.\u201d   It is about building conspiracy cases bit by bit.   That morning at the border, three special agents noticed the black letters stamped on the bricks of heroin: LEY. \u201cThat\u2019s probably from the Chino Leys, probably Sinaloa,\u201d said one of the agents, who declined to provide his name because he works undercover.   The Chino Leys, he said, are one of the drug distribution organizations in the Sinaloa cartel, which controls the routes that slice through Arizona, aimed for the Northeast. Cleveland, New York and New Jersey are main destinations for Sinaloa\u2019s heroin these days.   The driver said he had borrowed his cousin\u2019s car to come to Nogales to buy sweaters. The disbelieving agent pressed on. The driver crossed his arms.   \u201cThe guy\u2019s not talking,\u201d the agent said.  FERNANDA SANTOS   Huntington, Utah   As she drives to work each morning, past horse ranches and nodding oil pumps, Marsha World stops to give her son, Kolton, a pale yellow pill to help keep him off heroin for another day.   There are few options for drug treatment in the high desert of central Utah, a remote expanse of struggling coal mines, white-steepled Mormon towns and some of the country\u2019s highest opiate death rates.   The lone doctor licensed to prescribe one addiction-treating drug has a waiting list. The main detox center is the county jail. So mothers like Ms. World occupy the lonely front lines of a heroin crisis that has reached deep into the remotest corners of rural America.   The sun was just skimming over the sagebrush hills when Ms. World climbed out of her car and palmed that day\u2019s naltrexone pill for her 30-year-old son. Unlike other medications Mr. World has taken over 11 years of addiction and rehab, jail and relapse, this one seemed to help.   Mr. World was in a treatment program ordered by the local drug court, and Ms. World had promised the judge she would keep the pills at her house and bring one to him. Every day.   The rate of prescription overdose deaths among the 32,000 people sprinkled across two neighboring counties in this corner of Utah is nearly four times the state average. Addiction has rippled through ranks of miners who relied on pain pills after years of digging coal and working in the power plants.   Karen Dolan, who runs the  Four Corners Behavioral Health  center in the nearby town of Price, the only substance-abuse facility for miles, said three of her staff members had lost family members to addiction. At the power plant where her husband works, some of his co-workers\u2019 family members have died of overdoses. Heroin accounts for 31 percent of the clinic\u2019s admissions, up from 3 percent in 2010.   \u201cPeople call every day and say, \u2018Do you have an opening?\u2019\u201d Ms. Dolan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money to pay for medication-assisted treatment, and we don\u2019t have prescribers to provide treatment.\u201d   After years struggling with heroin addiction in Salt Lake City, Mr. World moved back in 2013, to the community where he had grown up in a loving family that went to Mormon services on weekends. (He is no longer a part of the church.)   But it was no sanctuary. When Mr. World found a stray Chihuahua on the road a few months ago, it turned out the dog\u2019s young owner was in jail because of an opiate addiction. And getting drugs here proved just as easy as in the city: One Facebook message to an acquaintance did it.   But it has been more than 300 days since he last used. His days now are work, therapy, random drug tests at the sheriff\u2019s office and morning visits from Mom.   \u201cLove you,\u201d she said after he took his pill. She hugged her son and his boyfriend goodbye, and drove to her job at the dry cleaner.   JACK HEALY   Milwaukee   Sometimes they call themselves \u201cthe last responders.\u201d   They work in the county medical examiner\u2019s office, in a low-slung brick building downtown in the shadow of an old Pabst factory. Here is where they take over after a  drug addiction  has been more powerful than pleas from family, 12-step programs or even Narcan.   \u201cWe\u2019re the end of the line,\u201d said Sara Schreiber, the forensic technical director, walking through the autopsy rooms to talk about the office\u2019s part in the opioid addiction epidemic \u2014 a crisis that has hit especially hard here.   Last year, 299 people in Milwaukee County died of drug-related overdoses. One of them was the medical examiner\u2019s own son.   Adam Peterson died in September at the age of 29, found unresponsive in a friend\u2019s apartment. \u201cAt this time I am not speaking publicly about Adam\u2019s death, and I appreciate your forbearance as my wife and I work through this issue,\u201d his father, Brian L. Peterson, the medical examiner, wrote in an email.   Dr. Peterson has continued his work despite his grief. He oversees a staff of nearly 30 people \u2014 administrators, toxicologists and laboratory employees \u2014 who have perhaps never been more overwhelmed. They are confronting a surge of drug-related deaths in Milwaukee County, the most populous county in Wisconsin, with nearly one million people in the city and suburbs.   They have witnessed an alarming rise in drug-related deaths for years now: 251 deaths in 2014, 255 in 2015, and they surpassed those figures in 2016. Dr. Peterson\u2019s son was among those who died last summer in a surge of overdoses that in seven weeks took more than 70 lives.   Ms. Schreiber has witnessed much of the epidemic. The victims have been mostly middle-aged; more male than female; more white than black.   As she walked through the laboratory, she pointed out the epidemic\u2019s effects. Now, the machines that analyze blood to help determine the ever-more-toxic blends of drugs are running far more often. They\u2019re juggling more cases and analyzing more specimens than before.   Ms. Schreiber and her colleagues struggle with questions that they cannot answer. What can they do to stem the epidemic? How can they influence people while they are still alive?   It\u2019s hard to know where to begin, she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t outrun it.\u201d    JULIE BOSMAN",

This is not \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but \u201c A World Trimmed With Fur: Wild Things, Pristine Places, and the Natural Fringes of Qing Rule ,\u201d a new book by the historian  Jonathan Schlesinger  that analyzes the complex relationships among the exploitation of natural resources, environmental regulation and ethnic identity under the ruling Manchus of the Qing dynasty,  China \u2019s last.   Mr. Schlesinger, a scholar of imperial China at Indiana University in Bloomington, studied Manchurian and Mongolian archives to track the trade in furs, pearls and mushrooms across the Qing empire\u2019s borderlands in the 18th and 19th centuries. He writes that Qing rulers created protected areas and limited harvests in response to environmental degradation and to reflect imperial politics that linked Manchu and Mongolian identity with a romanticized vision of unspoiled nature.   \u201cThe empire did not preserve nature in its borderlands; it invented it,\u201d Mr. Schlesinger writes in the introduction. \u201cThe book documents the history of this invention and explores the environmental pressures and institutional frameworks that informed it.\u201d In an interview, he discussed how Qing officials managed natural resources, their influence on conservation in contemporary China and the parallels between early conservation policies in China and the West.   You write that Qing officials alternated between arresting people for extracting resources and setting up licensing systems for these activities. Which approach did they settle on?   The Qing court actually never quite settled on a single approach. Instead, its responses depended on the locality and the resource. In some cases, as with timber production in  Mongolia , the court endorsed a licensing plan that could better control and capitalize on trade. In other cases, the court took the opposite approach and banned production altogether, as during Mongolia\u2019s rush for wild mushrooms, when the court feared widespread poaching and undocumented migration were destroying the environment and Mongol way of life.   Many historians argue that Chinese statecraft embraced a more pro-development attitude towards resource exploitation in these years. The real story is a bit more complicated. Preservationist policies often won out.   Was there any germ in these policies of what we would now consider \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d?    Yes, I think, but with caveats. There are some important differences between Qing environmental thought and our own. Qing subjects aimed to save their empire and its constituent parts, not the planet. They never justified their positions in terms of the sciences. They also lacked any umbrella organization or agency dedicated to managing the environment. In all of these respects, there are significant differences between modern environmentalism and what was practiced in the Qing world.   That said, I do think, and try to show in the book, that many of the practices and concepts that were operative in the Qing \u2014 for example, the ways the court organized policies around \u201cpurity\u201d in Mongolia and the idea of \u201cnurturing the mussels\u201d in Manchuria \u2014 were in many ways congruent with what you see in other parts of the world in the 19th century. In the Qing, ethnic identity profoundly informed environmental politics, and Qing officials justified environmental protection in part as a way of defending the Manchu and Mongol homelands \u2014 just as many in the German-speaking world saw nature protection as a pathway to redemption for the German \u201cVolk,\u201d and Americans called for national parks to preserve the country\u2019s national spirit. This powerful connection between identity and environment is not unique to modern Western environmentalism. It has a more complicated past.   You say we should think about environmental history outside a Western paradigm.    Sometimes it\u2019s easy to think that the environmental history of the West is the standard by which we should measure environmental histories of other places, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the appropriate method for understanding the history of the Qing empire. Now, I do think there are fruitful comparisons between what was going on in Europe or the Qing empire at the time. But I don\u2019t necessarily think we should measure the Qing solely using terminology or models that we assume to be universal, but that in fact derive from and best describe European or American history.   Does this history hold any lessons for modern China?   One of the lessons is that there\u2019s no place in China, or in countries around China, where there is unspoiled, pristine nature. If something appears to be unspoiled and pristine, chances are it\u2019s because someone worked to make it that way at some point in time, and people have consistently worked to make it that way.   Which protected lands in China are you thinking of?   I think of  Changbaishan . It\u2019s this volcano on the border between North Korea and China, and the Manchus considered the lake inside the crater at the top to be holy territory. It was special because it was the birthplace of the Manchus. The court had special rules on collecting ginseng or trapping sable or other fur-bearing animals on the mountain. When British explorers first climbed the mountain in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they referred to it as untouched and unspoiled nature.   In fact, it was very much touched. People had been poaching on the land, but the court had been using its resources to protect that territory. The People\u2019s Republic of China has converted this space into a  nature reserve . They are in many ways picking up where the Qing left off.",

It also suspended high-level economic talks and said staff at the consulate in Busan would not attend events organized by the city government.   South Korea showed no sign of acquiescing to Japan\u2019s demand that it immediately remove the statue in Busan, a port city in the country\u2019s southeast. \u201cWe want to stress again that despite difficult issues facing us, both governments must strive to develop bilateral relations based on mutual trust,\u201d said Cho June-hyuck, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, who called Japan\u2019s announcement \u201cregrettable.\u201d   South Korea\u2019s Finance Ministry urged Tokyo to keep diplomatic disputes out of economic and financial relations.   Washington has repeatedly appealed to South Korea and Japan to overcome the persistent, bitter legacies of Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule over Korea in the first half of the 20th century and to work more closely together to better address North Korea\u2019s advancing threat of nuclear weapons and China\u2019s expanding influence.   But the issue of the comfort women, as the former sex slaves were euphemistically called in Japan and South Korea, remains seemingly intractable, despite a 2015 agreement between the countries that was meant to put the dispute behind them.   Surviving former sex slaves and their advocates  angered Japan  in 2011 when they installed the first in a series of comfort woman statues, in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. The bronze, life-size statue, of a barefoot girl in traditional Korean dress sitting in a chair, was placed so that diplomats would see it as they left the office. It is still there, with Korean activists guarding it around the clock to ensure that it is not removed.   Since then, activists have put up dozens more such statues, in South Korea and abroad. But the one in Busan was only the second to be installed near a Japanese diplomatic mission.   Mr. Kawamura said that statue violated the spirit of  the deal the countries struck in December 2015  to resolve their dispute over the extent of Tokyo\u2019s responsibility for what the women had to endure. In that agreement, which both sides called \u201ca final and irreversible resolution,\u201d Japan apologized and promised $8.3 million to care for the surviving women, in return for South Korea\u2019s promise not to press any future claims. South Korea also promised to discuss Japan\u2019s complaint about the Seoul statue with activists and survivors.   \u201cEach side, Japan and South Korea respectively, should implement the agreement with a sense of responsibility,\u201d Mr. Kawamura said, specifying that the deal should extend to the statue in Busan.   South Korea also reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement, though it has proved to be one of the most unpopular decisions made by President Park Geun-hye, whose powers have been suspended since the National Assembly  voted to impeach her  last month over a corruption scandal. The agreement fell short of the survivors\u2019 demand that Japan pay formal reparations and accept legal responsibility for what happened to them.   On Dec. 28, the first anniversary of the agreement, civic groups in Busan installed the statue on a sidewalk near the Japanese Consulate, despite repeated protests from Tokyo and the consulate.   The local government immediately removed it, saying it had been placed there without permission, but bowed to public pressure two days later and allowed it to be put back. A visit that week by Japan\u2019s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which commemorates a number of convicted war criminals along with Japan\u2019s other war dead, had deepened resentments in South Korea.   Shinsuke Sugiyama, Japan\u2019s vice minister for foreign affairs, who is in Washington attending talks with his American and South Korean counterparts to discuss North Korea and other security issues, lodged an official complaint with his South Korean counterpart, Lim Sung-nam, over the Busan statue on Thursday. For his part, Mr. Lim strongly protested Ms. Inada\u2019s visit to the shrine, officials here said on Friday.   Japan last recalled its envoy to Seoul in 2012, after South Korea\u2019s president at the time,  Lee Myung-bak, flew to a set of islets  that both countries claim as their territory. The ambassador returned after 12 days. South Korea temporarily recalled its own ambassador to Tokyo in 2008, to protest new guidelines for Japanese textbooks that asserted Japan\u2019s  claim to those islets .",

The general, Gatot Nurmantyo, is an ardent nationalist who is thought to have political ambitions of his own.   The suspension of military ties with Australia threatened Indonesia\u2019s efforts to improve relations with its southern neighbor and raised the specter of a deep split between the two countries, both vital American allies in the region.   In a news conference Thursday night, Indonesia\u2019s chief security minister said the suspension of military cooperation, announced earlier in the week, was limited only to language training, which remained suspended. The minister, Wiranto, stressed that \u201cthe bilateral relationship of both countries is running well.\u201d   \u201cIt does not mean the breaking of our defense cooperation fully,\u201d he added. Mr. Wiranto, like many Indonesians, goes by one name.   The confusing signals from Indonesia\u2019s military come as Mr. Joko faces stark shifts in the nation\u2019s political landscape amid the falling fortunes of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the governor of Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital. Mr. Basuki, also known as Ahok, was widely considered a potential running mate for Mr. Joko\u2019s re-election effort in 2019.   But Mr. Basuki, an ethnic Chinese Christian, is  fighting blasphemy charges and faces jail  after  large Islamist-led rallies against him , potentially hurting his hopes in February of becoming the first non-Muslim to be elected governor of Jakarta.  He inherited the governorship  from Mr. Joko after Mr. Joko won the presidency in 2014. A defeat for Mr. Basuki in court could spell trouble for Mr. Joko in 2019.   \u201cUp until September, everything seemed calm for Jokowi,\u201d said Philips J. Vermonte, executive director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. \u201cRe-election was assured. And then the storm came, and that storm was in a package called Ahok.\u201d   The turmoil could have provided a political opening for General Gatot by publicly breaking with the Australian military over an issue of national honor. Officials said the suspension in military cooperation was precipitated by the discovery on an Australian training base of materials that apparently disparaged Pancasila, Indonesia\u2019s founding state ideology, which mandates belief in monotheism and unity among Indonesia\u2019s 250 million people.   General Gatot, who has positioned himself as a defender of Indonesia, is widely thought to have political ambitions of his own. He is deeply suspicious of China and the United States. He has publicly mused that food shortages in China may send waves of hungry Chinese southward toward Indonesia. He has also claimed that the cause of gay rights amounts to a proxy war by Western interests to erode Indonesian culture.   \u201cIt is a public secret that Gatot has political ambitions, and it will be a challenge for Jokowi to manage them as we approach the 2019 polls,\u201d said Marcus Mietzner, an associate professor who studies Indonesian politics and the military at the Australia National University in Canberra, the Australian capital.   \u201cGatot senses that his views are now falling on fertile ground, and that emboldens him further,\u201d Mr. Mietzner added.   Publicly, Mr. Joko stood by his general\u2019s decision to suspend military ties, calling it a \u201cmatter of principle.\u201d   But Mr. Mietzner said Mr. Joko\u2019s government, already tested by the huge rallies against Mr. Basuki, would be eager to put the flare-up with Australia to rest.   \u201cNo doubt there will be serious discussions within the Indonesian government about how such a momentous diplomatic decision could have been taken by the head of the armed forces without involving the political leadership,\u201d Mr. Mietzner said.",

Last year, he submitted his poem to Chest, which ran it in its October issue.   \u201cAs a thoracic surgeon, I have diagnosed many patients with ground-glass opacity adenocarcinoma in my regular clinical practice,\u201d he said in an telephone interview, referring to tumors. \u201cI hope this poem will help more people understand it and take it seriously.\u201d   As for why the poem was told from a cancer\u2019s perspective, Dr. Zhao said he was inspired by reading science fiction.   \u201cI think everything in this world has consciousness and determination,\u201d he said.   \u201cSometimes when I look at the scan images and see the shadows of G.G.O., I can feel it growing stronger with a will and a tribe of its own,\u201d he added, referring to ground-glass opacity. \u201cSo I thought, why not write down what the G.G.O. and cancer would be thinking?\u201d   Dr. Zhao said that in his surgical practice he has noticed more and more nonsmokers who have developed lung cancer.   \u201cMost of the female lung cancer patients are nonsmokers,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are little girls. I even had a 9-year-old patient, a little girl, and we had to cut out part of her lung. I\u2019ll never forget her.\u201d   \u201cBut I am confident about the government\u2019s determination\u201d to tackle air pollution, he added.   In its 13th Five-Year Plan, announced last year, the Chinese government\u2019s   goal for 2020  is for the air in all major cities to meet \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d standards \u2014 meaning air quality index readings of less than 100 \u2014 80 percent of the time. The Beijing municipal government has pledged to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in the city\u2019s air 25 percent this year compared with levels for 2012.",

   "7. content": "Thousands of people die in distracted-driving accidents every year, including more than 3,400 in 2015, according to federal data released last week. California is hoping to do something about it.   A law went into effect in the state last week with an aim toward cutting down on the number of drivers using smartphones.   As traffic deaths rise at  the fastest rate in the last half-century , many states have taken steps to reduce  distracted driving . But while  46 states and the District of Columbia ban texting  by drivers, only 14 prohibit the use of any mobile device while driving.   With its new law, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in September and effective Jan. 1, California has gone further than most states in prohibiting the use of cellphones: It is barring drivers from even holding mobile devices.   The law builds on earlier legislation that prevented drivers from talking and texting but did not prohibit them from streaming video, for instance, or using apps like Facebook and Twitter.   Late last month, a Texas couple  filed a lawsuit against Apple  over a 2014 accident in which a driver using the video-calling app FaceTime crashed into their car, killing their 5-year-old daughter.   Jennifer Ryan, the director of state relations for the travel organization AAA, said the California measure matched a larger trend in which states were bringing legislation up to date with contemporary phones. Many of the existing laws were passed before smartphones offered the number of interactive features that they do today, she said.   \u201cWe certainly anticipate there to be many bills introduced this year,\u201d she added.   Ms. Ryan said that California\u2019s provisions were particularly broad and that although it was \u201cdefinitely a bellwether state,\u201d states tended to evaluate policy solutions to distracted driving independently. AAA expects to see legislation introduced to address distracted driving in about 10 states, including Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, Virginia and Wisconsin.   According to new statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 272 teenagers were killed in 2015 in what the agency described as distraction-affected crashes. The data also showed that 3,263 of the 3,477 people killed in such crashes that year had been distracted while driving.   California\u2019s law goes beyond even what the federal agency recommends to prevent distracted driving, said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the agency.   \u201cWe certainly have encouraged states to adopt \u2018no texting and driving\u2019 laws. That\u2019s been a big focus,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThe most recent action has been on what can be done on manufacturers of both cars and devices on how to minimize distraction.\u201d   But even given California\u2019s comparatively extensive law, some experts are unconvinced that legislation alone can significantly reduce the threat of distracted driving.   Steve Finnegan, the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California, said that although the new legislation was \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d it did not address \u201cthe complete issue of distracted driving.\u201d   \u201cOne of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction,\u201d Mr. Finnegan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what your hands are doing; it\u2019s what your brain is doing.\u201d   David G. Kidd, a senior researcher at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent research organization that focuses on reducing injuries and fatalities from crashes, agreed and said that research on public policy that banned smartphone use had returned mixed results.   \u201cThere is evidence that if you do pass a law and have strong enforcement, it can change behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see a reduction in crashes that is consistent with that change in behavior.\u201d   The institute is more focused on encouraging automakers to adapt crash avoidance technologies such as forward-collision warnings and automatic emergency braking \u2014 technological measures that are intended to help prevent front-to-rear crashes.   Those systems \u201care not going to reduce driver distraction, but they will help cope with some of the consequences that come with drivers not paying attention,\u201d Mr. Kidd said.   Ms. Ryan, of AAA, said drivers\u2019 safety ultimately rested in their hands and those of their fellow motorists.   \u201cWe really want to emphasize to motorists that driving is a very demanding task,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople really need to pay attention to the task at hand and not drive distracted.\u201d",

Later, the authorities say, she rented a helicopter using a fake name and then tried to hijack it in an effort to rescue her imprisoned partner.   On Friday, the anarchist leader, Panagiota Roupa, was charged with theft, forgery and participating in a terrorist organization. She was arrested on Thursday in a house in Ilioupoli, a middle-class suburb southeast of Athens, where she was living under an assumed identity. Her 6-year-old was taken into protective custody.   \u201cBe careful with my son,\u201d she told the officers, according to Theodoros Chronopoulos, the chief spokesman for the national police.   Greek officials called Ms. Roupa, 47 \u2014 known by her nickname, Pola \u2014 the country\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 most-wanted\u201d terrorist. With her partner, Nikos Maziotis, she was a leader of Revolutionary Struggle, which carried out a string of bombings and shootings targeting the police and others starting in 2003, and  fired an antitank grenade  at the United States Embassy in Athens in 2007. The attacks caused several injuries, but no deaths.   \u201cShe is the No. 1 most-wanted domestic terrorist, as she has been crucial in managing the Revolutionary Struggle, but more specifically in recruiting,\u201d Mr. Chronopoulos said in a phone interview.   Starting in 2010, Ms. Roupa and Mr. Maziotis served 18 months in pretrial detention, the maximum possible, on terrorism charges. They were released in 2012 and were required to check in with the local police once a week, but instead they went on the run. In 2013, they were  sentenced in absentia to 50 years in prison . Another leader of the group, Costas Gournas, also received a 50-year sentence.   The group, which had been thought to be inactive, claimed responsibility for an April 2014 bomb that was placed in a parked car in central Athens. No one was injured in the attack. That July, Mr. Maziotis was  arrested  after a shootout with the police in central Athens in which he and three other people \u2014 a police officer, a German tourist and an Australian tourist \u2014 were injured.   Early last year, the police said, Ms. Roupa tried to free Mr. Maziotis and other prisoners. She rented a helicopter and tried to force the pilot at gunpoint to fly over the prison where they were being held. But the pilot refused, and in the struggle that followed, he managed to regain control and land the helicopter. Ms. Roupa ran off.   \u201cOver the last year, the police had been collecting significant information and indications leading us to the municipalities of southern Athens,\u201d Mr. Chronopoulos said on Thursday. The police monitored the house over the past three days, he said, and on Wednesday evening, \u201cwhen we were made sure that it was indeed Pola Roupa living in that house, we decided that it was time to go in with the raid.\u201d   A 25-year-old woman, Konstantina Athanassopoulou, who the police said was babysitting the son, was arrested in a nearby suburb and faces the same charges as Ms. Roupa.   According to her lawyer, Fragiskos Ragousis, Ms. Roupa is prepared to accept responsibility for violating the terms of her release from pretrial detention, and for her involvement with the 2014 car bombing.   \u201cShe is planning to assume complete political responsibility for her actions, but she is demanding that her child is given to her mother and sister,\u201d Mr. Ragousis said in a phone interview.   Mr. Ragousis \u2014 a colorful lawyer with a history of representing leftist guerrillas, including  Christodoulos Xiros , a member of the terrorist group known as November 17 \u2014 said of Ms. Roupa, \u201cGiven her social action, the fact that she is an urban guerrilla fighter, it\u2019s my great honor to represent her.\u201d   News of Ms. Roupa\u2019s arrest dominated the Greek news and social media. On Twitter, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the center-right New Democracy, the main opposition party, congratulated the Greek police for capturing Ms. Roupa and continuing the fight against terrorism.   Thanasis Bakolas, a spokesman for New Democracy, said in a phone interview that the leftist Syriza, the leading party in the government, had not done enough to crack down on militant leftist groups, \u201cto which Syriza was ideologically and politically close prior to becoming the governing party.\u201d (Reached by phone, representatives of Syriza did not comment.)   Ms. Roupa\u2019s sister, Christianna, read a statement from Ms. Roupa, in which she pledged to be \u201can unremorseful enemy of the system until I die.\u201d   The statement added, \u201cWe are at war \u2014 this is a fact.\u201d It also said that she would go on a hunger strike until her son was turned over to her family, concluding that she would \u201cremain their enemy until I die, and they will never break me.\u201d   \u201cLong live the revolution!\u201d it said.   Some of Ms. Roupa\u2019s supporters expressed their solidarity on Twitter, suggesting that she was no more of a criminal than Greek politicians.",

At this stage nobody knows which it will be. As Jeffrey Gettleman  reported in T he Times , Mr. Kabila, who has already overstayed his term in office, is probably not interested in remaining president for life. Holed up in his Kinshasa mansion, he has shown little interest in ruling Congo, and he has already looted his resource-rich country of untold millions. But like many another rapacious strongmen, the president, who is 45, is also keenly aware that his loot and his life are safe only as long as he has the presidential levers and guns to preserve them.   In theory, the bishops, or the opposition, or some other country, could offer him amnesty and a haven if he left peacefully. But Congo has one of the most violent histories in Africa, and Mr. Kabila\u2019s brutal police tactics have made him many enemies in his 16 years in office. And he is aware that no offer carries a guarantee \u2014 Charles Taylor, the equally repressive former president of neighboring Liberia, left office under international pressure only to be arrested and sentenced to 50 years in prison by an international tribunal.   So there is every reason to be skeptical that Mr. Kabila will honor the deal. In fact, while members of both his and the opposition party have signed it, he has not \u2014 thinking, perhaps, that he can kick the can down the road and that a solution that preserves his power will pop up. It is therefore up to the bishops, the opposition, the United States and others interested in bringing a modicum of democracy to Congo to persuade him that he has been offered the best and only available exit plan.   The United States has already imposed sanctions on some of Mr. Kabila\u2019s top officials for interfering in the democratic process, and has advised the president that the sooner he steps down the better his chances of avoiding prosecution. Western envoys also have been calling on the president to step down. But more pressure is needed: The Catholic Church, to which about half the population belongs, and which created the deal, can now help mobilize the people behind it.",

And it is the whole world. Is this what Zionism is about?\u201d   For a second consecutive day on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu denounced the departing Obama administration, publicly accusing it of having orchestrated Friday\u2019s Security Council resolution, despite denials from Washington. The United States  refrained from using its veto power , as it had done many times before to shield Israel, and abstained in the 14-to-0 vote.   \u201cFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting.   Referring to the American secretary of state, Mr. Netanyahu added, \u201cAs I told  John Kerry  on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d and he said he was looking forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump's administration when it takes office next month.   The Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors of countries that had voted in favor of the resolution for personal meetings with ministry officials in Jerusalem, despite the Christmas holiday, which some of those countries celebrate.   In a highly unusual move, Mr. Netanyahu, who is also the foreign minister, summoned the American ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a meeting on Sunday night.   Mr. Netanyahu also instructed his ministers to reduce their diplomatic activities and contacts with counterparts from the countries that had voted for the resolution for the next three weeks, until the American administration changes, and to minimize travel to those countries, according to Israeli news reports.   In an additional step, the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, instructed Israel\u2019s agencies to suspend contact with Palestinian Authority representatives on some unspecified civil matters, though the measure was not supposed to affect security coordination or meetings about water, agriculture and the economy.   With the Israeli occupation in its 50th year and the peace process frozen, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and the Palestinians\u2019 veteran negotiator, called on Israel \u201cto seize the opportunity, to wake up, to stop the violence, to stop settlements and to resume negotiations.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu says he is ready for negotiations anytime, but with no preconditions.   The Security Council vote seemed to have caught Israel off guard.   \u201cI hope for Netanyahu\u2019s sake (and also for ours) that he knows the truth at least deep in his heart \u2014 it was the chronicle of a failure foretold,\u201d Ben Caspit, a political commentator, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Sunday.   Many commentators said the Security Council vote partly reflected a  history of conflict  between Mr. Netanyahu and  President Obama  over the settlements and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s anger over the Iranian nuclear deal. They also pointed to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s increasingly vocal backing of the settler cause. That includes his advancement of highly contentious legislation, known as the  Regulation Bill , that would retroactively legalize  settler outposts  and homes built on privately owned Palestinian land and force the owners to accept compensation.   Mr. Netanyahu and his attorney general had warned that the bill, which recently passed a first reading in Parliament, contravenes international law and could land Israeli officials in the defendant dock of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.   \u201cAfter he said it, he rushed to vote in favor of the bill. Why?\u201d Mr. Caspit wrote. \u201cBecause of Bennett. The fear of the possibility that he would not be able to siphon seats from Bennett next time on Election Day caused him to act like a small-time grocery owner, instead of a national leader.\u201d   Tzipi Livni, a former Israeli foreign minister and a leader of the center-left Zionist Union, wrote  on Facebook  after the Security Council vote, \u201cThe Security Council decision is bad for Israel and it is the result of Netanyahu\u2019s surrender to the extreme right.\u201d   Even Haggai Segal, a prominent settler and the editor in chief of a right-wing newspaper, Makor Rishon, wrote in recent months that the Regulation Bill had \u201cno chance\u201d because it would be invalidated by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court and would be used by the International Criminal Court \u201cto incriminate Israel for war crimes.\u201d   Mr. Segal, who served jail time as a member of the Jewish Underground that maimed and killed Palestinians in the 1980s, wrote this summer, \u201cThe wise thing now is to make do with what it is possible to do, and not lose it all by insisting on impossible goals.\u201d   Mr. Bennett did not seem deterred. In a statement to reporters on Sunday at the Western Wall in the Old City in East Jerusalem, Mr. Bennett said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to decide between two alternatives: surrendering our land or sovereignty.\u201d He added that steps would be taken in the near future to try to apply Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, the biblical terms for the West Bank.   But some Israelis were skeptical that Mr. Netanyahu, in his third consecutive term in office, and fourth over all, would choose one side over the other.   \u201cBennett knows that Netanyahu is not going to make a decision,\u201d said Shmuel Sandler, a professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe may say he will go with both. So far, it worked. It is easier for Bennett because he is not the prime minister. Netanyahu wants to enjoy both of the worlds.\u201d",

Ambassadors from 10 of the 14 countries that voted in favor of the resolution and have embassies in Israel - Britain, China, Russia, France, Egypt, Japan, Uruguay, Spain, Ukraine and New Zealand - were summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, the ministry said. Sunday is a regular work day in Israel, but most embassies are closed, and calling in envoys on Christmas Day is highly unusual. At the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu described a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, when Israel and President-elect Donald Trump successfully pressed Egypt to drop the anti-settlement resolution it had put forward. It was resubmitted a day later by New Zealand, Senegal, Venezuela and Malaysia. \u201cOver decades American administrations and Israeli governments disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the security council was not the place to resolve this issue,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cWe knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace farther away. As I told John Kerry on Thursday, \u2018Friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council\u2019,\u201d he said, switching from Hebrew to English. Israel has pursued a policy of constructing settlements on territory it captured in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors - the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, areas Palestinians seek for a state. Most countries view the settlement activity as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees, citing biblical and historical connections to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as security interests.

The film drew controversy soon after plans for the series were unveiled earlier this week, with  actors Wendell Pierce and Ellen Pompeo among those criticizing the project on social media  and Pierce calling for a network boycott, Variety reported. Pierce demanded A&E provide evidence that the documentary subjects were not paid for their participation, as subjects of reality TV programs typically would be, and the network insisted that no such payments were made, according to Variety. On Saturday, however, the network acknowledged learning from its third-party producers that some cash payments were made to Klan members who participated in the documentary \u201cin order to facilitate access\u201d to them. The network statement said the payments, though \u201cunderstood to be nominal,\u201d were nevertheless \u201ca direct violation of A&E\u2019s policies and practices for a documentary.\u201d \n The Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, long relegated to the fringe of American discourse, have gained growing attention during the past year as their leaders vocally embraced the presidential candidacy of Republican Donald Trump and exulted in his Nov. 8 victory. Trump has disavowed their support, though he has appointed Steve Bannon, former head of the website Breitbart News - a forum for a range of far right-wing opinion-makers, including white nationalists, neo-Nazis and anti-Semites - to serve as his chief White House strategist. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our  terms.

   "7. content": "When Tiah Joo Kim arrived at the Manhattan headquarters of the Trump Organization to pitch a hotel and condominium project in Vancouver, British Columbia, he expected the famous company with ventures across the globe to come with capacious offices and a staff of hundreds. Instead, he was led through a mere two floors with what appeared to be no more than a few dozen employees. \u201cLean,\u201d Mr. Tiah, a young Malaysian developer, remembers thinking as he walked the halls.   The first stop was a conference room, where Mr. Tiah was required to sell his vision to the boss\u2019s three oldest children. Only after securing their support did he advance to the inner sanctum, with its sweeping views of Central Park.   Mr. Tiah was not sure what to expect from the man whose face was beamed around the world through the reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d but the conversation that afternoon in 2012 was casual and warm. Donald J. Trump spent more time showing off a Shaquille O\u2019Neal shoe and a Mike Tyson championship belt \u2014 prize artifacts from his display of sports memorabilia \u2014 than interrogating Mr. Tiah on the details of his business plan. \u201cYou\u2019re a good-looking guy,\u201d Mr. Tiah recalled Mr. Trump telling him as he gave the project his blessing.   Then Mr. Trump\u2019s trusted lawyers and other top executives swooped in to play hardball \u2014 working alongside Donald Trump Jr. to negotiate the confidential agreements that would allow the Vancouver development to be branded with Mr. Trump\u2019s name and managed by his company. The talks consumed 16-hour days for nearly a week, Mr. Tiah said, explaining: \u201cIt was tiring. They\u2019re tough.\u201d   That is the way business has been done at the Trump Organization, a relatively small company with a big reach and a bigger self-image that has come under intense scrutiny as its chief prepares to become president of the United States.   With extensive entanglements around the world, many packaged in a network of licensing agreements and limited liability companies, the Trump Organization poses a raft of potential conflicts of interest for a president-elect who has long exerted such control over his company that, as he told The New York Times in  a recent interview , he is the one who signs the checks. \u201cI like to sign checks so I know what is going on,\u201d he explained.   Mr. Trump \u2014 owner of all but the smallest sliver of the privately held company \u2014 has said that, while the law does not require it, he is formulating plans to remove himself and his older daughter, Ivanka, from the company\u2019s operations. (Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, is likely to have a role in the White House.) His sons Donald Jr. and Eric, along with other executives, will be in charge, the president-elect  wrote on Twitter  in mid-December, adding that \u201cno new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.\u201d People involved in the planning have said that Mr. Trump intends to keep a stake in the business.   But in recent weeks, amid rising pressure, Mr. Trump and his advisers have been  intensely debating further measures . Among other things, the president-elect has agreed to shut down his personal foundation, has ended some international development deals and has reviewed a plan for an outside monitor to oversee the Trump Organization.   Yet an examination of the company underscores the complex challenges of taking Mr. Trump out of Trump the organization.   His company is a distinctly family business fortified with longtime loyalists that operates less on standardized procedures and more on a culture of Trump. Mr. Trump may leave the details of contracts to his deputies, but his name \u2014 and influence \u2014 is stamped on every deal the company does.   In an interview last spring with The Times, Mr. Trump explained that he approved new ventures based on his personal \u201cfeel.\u201d And while in recent years his three oldest children have taken on more of a leadership role, Mr. Trump has the final say, sometimes weighing in on the most minute design details of planned hotels, golf courses or other properties the company owns or manages.   His other top executives \u2014 many of them natives of Queens, where Mr. Trump grew up, or Brooklyn, where his father, Fred, expanded a housing empire many years ago \u2014 have secured power not necessarily through fancy pedigrees or impressive credentials, but through decades of devotion to their boss.   Allen Weisselberg, the organization\u2019s chief financial officer, started off as an accountant for Mr. Trump\u2019s father. Matthew Calamari, the organization\u2019s chief operating officer, was recruited in 1981 after Mr. Trump saw him eject some hecklers while working security at the United States Open tennis tournament.   For some executives, there appears to be little division between their service to the company and their service to the Trumps.   \u201cWe\u2019re not a publicly traded company. At the end of the day, I work for the Trump family,\u201d Alan Garten, the general counsel,  explained in an interview  with the legal industry publication Corporate Counsel shortly before the election. \u201cThat\u2019s how I view my job. Whether it\u2019s protecting their business interests or protecting their personal interests. I am here to assist them and represent them in any way they need.\u201d   When asked to elaborate in an interview last week with The Times, Mr. Garten said that in any job, \u201cyou want to be as helpful as you can,\u201d but that \u201cobviously the interests of the Trumps and the interests of the company are two distinct things.\u201d   The divisions between business and politics were often fuzzy during the presidential race: Mr. Garten became a \u201cliaison\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign; Michael Cohen, an executive vice president, tirelessly promoted his boss\u2019s bid for the White House on television while battling negative media coverage; and Jason Greenblatt, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, began serving as his adviser on Israel. On Friday, it was announced that Mr. Greenblatt would be joining Mr. Trump\u2019s administration as a special representative for international negotiations.   After the election, other lines continued to blur as the president-elect and his children met with foreign businessmen with connections to their global ventures and with foreign officials with potential influence over their business dealings.   Some government-ethics lawyers have warned that unless Mr. Trump fully divests himself from the company and places someone independent of his family in charge, he risks entering the White House in violation of a  constitutional clause  that forbids him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity.   As Mr. Trump assumes the presidency, it is difficult to foresee him walling himself off from the company entirely, said Michael D\u2019Antonio, the author of a critical biography, \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d   \u201cI don\u2019t think that he could keep himself from inquiring about the performance of these businesses any more than he can keep himself from tweeting,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio said. \u201cIt is just too vital to his identity. Profit is the way he has always measured himself. I don\u2019t see how he can stop.\u201d   Mr. Trump may have business interests around the world, but his power is concentrated at a single Midtown Manhattan address: 725 Fifth Avenue. With a gleaming exterior that shoots to the sky, a lobby decked with marble and a collection of high-end tenants, Trump Tower is his primary residence as well as his company\u2019s headquarters.   To get to work, Mr. Trump steps onto the private elevator in his gilded three-story penthouse, presses 26 and waits a matter of seconds. When the doors open, he is at his office, surrounded by Mr. Garten, Mr. Weisselberg and other top executives. One floor down are the offices of Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump, who joined the company in the 2000s and are now his top deputies and advance guard.   David Brecher, the chief executive of FM Home Loans, visited the Trump Organization about a decade ago to discuss a potential partnership and found the aesthetics telling.   \u201cDonald\u2019s floor,\u201d he said, recalling a swirl of gold trim and hues, \u201cis very his style.\u201d   \u201cThe kids,\u201d by contrast, \u201chave a very cool floor. Sleek. Marble.\u201d   Photographs of Mr. Trump with the rich and powerful adorn his office walls, and his desk often overflows with papers, evidence of his refusal to communicate by email.   When Mr. Trump wants to talk to someone, he calls out to his assistant, Rhona Graff, a Queens native whose office is right outside his door. She has been his gatekeeper for decades. Anyone seeking access to him over the phone has to go through Ms. Graff, sometimes with a secret code.   Mr. Trump often boasts of the size of the Trump Organization. \u201cIt\u2019s a big company,\u201d he said in the interview last spring. A spokeswoman said the business employed \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d   But industry experts estimate that no more than 4,000 people work for the Trump Organization worldwide. And executives say that the three floors that make up the headquarters appear to have no more than 150 employees.   It is a family business, as everyone involved is quick to explain. And the management structure is informal if not confusing, with deputies constantly buzzing in and out of the boss\u2019s office.   \u201cWe kind of run a little bit like a mom-and-pop in that sense,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said in a 2011 deposition for a lawsuit involving a Florida development. \u201cI guess there is an organizational chart, but in theory, there is not too many levels.\u201d He added: \u201cCould I make one? Yes. Is there one officially? Not that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d   Indeed, the elder Mr. Trump has tended to collect executives and assign duties through personal preference.   In 2004, Michelle Carlson was a young lawyer determined to move to California when a friend suggested that she meet with an acquaintance who could prove useful. She entered Mr. Trump\u2019s office hoping to secure a recommendation she could use to find work with real estate developers in Los Angeles, and she encountered a warm welcome.   \u201cI heard there was this nice Atlanta girl in the lobby,\u201d she remembered Mr. Trump saying as he offered her a seat. Then came a series of direct questions: What were her responsibilities at her current job? How did she view her own strengths? In what areas did she want to grow?   Forty-five minutes later, Mr. Trump was convinced: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you any recommendations in L.A. I\u2019m going to hire you,\u201d Mr. Trump told Ms. Carlson, who went on to spend almost four years as his assistant general counsel, often working 18-hour days with a small team of lawyers while taking on other responsibilities in the real estate division.   Andrew Weiss, a Romanian immigrant who grew up in Brooklyn, was hired straight out of graduate school in 1981, just as Mr. Trump was starting to make his mark. Thirty-five years later, having weathered many highs and lows with Mr. Trump, including the spectacular failure of his Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Weiss is still by his side, as executive vice president for development and construction.   Mr. Calamari, who started out as a bodyguard, also saw his role expand as he remained committed to his boss. Five years ago, his son Matthew Calamari Jr. joined the Trump Organization as a security guard. Today, he is the director of surveillance. Brian Baudreau, the general manager of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, began as a driver for Mr. Trump.   \u201cMy father knows how to find talent in people,\u201d Eric Trump said, recalling how Mr. Baudreau used to chauffeur him to school. \u201cHe\u2019s totally family,\u201d he added.   Devotion is rewarded.   \u201cTo succeed in this company,\u201d Mr. Garten said, \u201cyou have to be skilled, highly dedicated and highly loyal.\u201d   Some appear to be hired based on other calculations.   For more than a decade, Ronald C. Lieberman oversaw the concession contracts for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, a post that required him to represent the interests of the city in a variety of deals with Mr. Trump.   Then, in 2007, Mr. Lieberman began working for a new employer. In his job as executive vice president for management and development at the Trump Organization, he has helped Mr. Trump win contracts to operate the Central Park carousel and the Ferry Point golf course in the Bronx, the very projects he handled on behalf of the city for years.   Ivanka Trump is generally seen as the second-most powerful person at the Trump Organization, while the 11 other executive vice presidents are all men \u2014 and all white.   There have been other senior female executives, like Cathy Hoffman Glosser, who oversaw the Trump Organization\u2019s expansion into branding deals, part of its shift from building and buying real estate to selling the Trump name. (She left the company last year and did not respond to interview requests. Ms. Carlson said she left by choice to care for her baby, even though Mr. Trump made earnest attempts to keep her.)   Mr. Garten said that outside the top executive ranks, \u201cthere\u2019s greater diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me.\u201d   Jill Martin, a vice president and assistant general counsel for litigation and employment, said in an interview last spring that diversity at the company was \u201cless forced\u201d than at the law firms where she previously worked.   \u201cWith the firms, there was a lot of attention placed on gender and ethnicity and trying to find the balance,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the Trump Organization, I just felt like those things really fall by the wayside. What\u2019s important is someone\u2019s individual drive and talent.\u201d   When Mr. Tiah was at Trump Tower to discuss the Vancouver partnership, he could not help noticing that female employees seemed to have something else in common.   \u201cYou have to be attractive?\u201d he remembers thinking. \u201cIs that a requirement?\u201d   It was the mid-2000s, and Phil Ruffin was in search of a partner to develop a combined hotel and condominium tower on the Las Vegas Strip. Mr. Ruffin, a casino tycoon, owned the land, but he needed an investor, a brand name to license and a team to manage the construction and operations of the property.   Mr. Trump did not simply say yes to all three, Mr. Ruffin recalled. He threw himself into the details of the deal, pushing a bank to cut the interest rate on a loan by half, insisting that subcontractors lower their prices and requiring that everything about the 64-story tower reflect his taste.   \u201cWe\u2019d tour, and he\u2019d say, \u2018This is wrong; this is right,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ruffin said. \u201cThe glass shower had to be etched glass because that\u2019s the Trump way, more expensive. He didn\u2019t want just a TV in the bathroom; it had to be in the mirror so you can watch when you\u2019re shaving.\u201d   Mr. Trump, he said, remained actively involved when the financial crisis hit in 2008, threatening the financial viability of the Las Vegas venture, and the two men flew to Washington to meet with a tax lawyer. As they pulled up chairs in his office, the lawyer encouraged the men to cut their losses and declare bankruptcy. It would provide them with a handsome tax deduction.   But Mr. Trump was adamant. \u201cHe said: \u2018This is not Atlantic City; this is Las Vegas. I think it will recover,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ruffin said. Instead, he and Mr. Trump poured more money into the venture and continued to move forward.   Mr. Trump\u2019s children have taken on increasing responsibility in recent years; they often solicit new projects and are the primary liaisons with partners. Two years ago, Eric Trump became the Trump Organization\u2019s main point of contact for the Las Vegas tower, Mr. Ruffin said. Ivanka Trump initiated the leasing of the old Old Post Office building in Washington, envisioning it as a new Trump hotel.   But Mr. Trump has the final say on most deals, especially those involving his own money.   He has signed the licensing agreements, the leases \u2014 and the big checks. And the tangle of limited liability companies used to structure all of his deals revolve around a single point of power: Mr. Trump. As one former executive described it, the company is the \u201chub of a wheel, and he\u2019s in the middle.\u201d   The company adheres to few formal corporate guidelines or procedures.   When determining whether and how to enter business partnerships, nothing is decided by established committee, or through written recommendation by the children, Donald Trump Jr. explained in the 2011 deposition in the Florida case.   \u201cOther companies can operate like bureaucrats\u201d Mr. Tiah said. \u201cThey\u2019re not like that.\u201d   Even so, the executives are known for playing tough.   When seeking $470,000 in outstanding legal bills from the Trump Organization a decade ago, the lawyer Y. David Scharf accidentally included a single page of a separate legal bill to another client, the business magnate Carl C. Icahn.   How did Mr. Weisselberg, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief financial officer, respond?   \u201cMr. Weisselberg threatened to call Mr. Icahn and utilize this inadvertent clerical error in an effort to embarrass Mr. Scharf and my firm \u2014 unless my firm agreed to a 50 percent discount on the outstanding legal bills,\u201d David A. Piedra, a partner in Mr. Scharf\u2019s firm, Morrison Cohen, wrote in a 2007 letter to a lawyer representing Mr. Trump.   \u201cAs I am sure you realize,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthis threat, which smacks of extortion, is entirely inappropriate.\u201d   Mr. Scharf said in an interview that his firm had resolved the matter and bore no ill will toward Mr. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization or Mr. Trump.   At the time of the election, Mr. Trump\u2019s company was party to at least 75 lawsuits across the country, according to a nationwide tally by USA Today.   Mr. Garten said that not all of the lawsuits were substantial, but acknowledged that \u201cwe\u2019re extremely hands-on and meticulous in the legal aspects of the business.\u201d   As their boss advanced in the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump\u2019s executives remained fierce and aggressive.   When The Daily Beast was preparing to publish an article about Mr. Trump\u2019s first wife, Ivana, alleging in a divorce deposition that he had raped her, Michael Cohen, one of the organization\u2019s executive vice presidents,  wrongly insisted it was impossible  for a husband to rape his wife and made threats. He warned that if the reporter moved ahead with the article, \u201cI\u2019m going to mess your life up,\u201d according to  The Daily Beast\u2019s account .   It was just one of the many ways that Mr. Cohen had cultivated the image of a pit bull, a reputation he said was well deserved.   \u201cMr. Trump is more than just a boss to those of us who have been fortunate enough to be close to him, both professionally and personally,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s more like a patriarch, a mentor. These qualities make him very endearing to me, which is why I am so fiercely loyal to him and committed to protecting him at all costs.\u201d   He was not the only seemingly tireless proponent \u2014 and protector \u2014 of Mr. Trump\u2019s political pursuits. Mr. Garten, the general counsel, defended his boss\u2019s record and fought back against allegations that he had groped women and engaged in other sexual misconduct. At points it appeared as if he were threatening legal action on a daily basis against anyone who criticized Mr. Trump, including The Times and other news outlets.   Last December, after Mr. Garten dangled the possibility of legal action against a \u201csuper PAC\u201d promoting Jeb Bush and sent a cease-and-desist letter to an anti-tax group that ran $1 million in ads against Mr. Trump,  supporters of Mr. Bush complained to the Federal Election Commission  that the Trump Organization was illegally acting as an agent for the Trump campaign.   \u201cTrump and his agents have explicitly directed his corporate attorneys at the Organization to do the dirty work for the campaign,\u201d a lawyer wrote in the complaint, which is pending.   Six months later, Mr. Garten began to appear in the campaign\u2019s financial reports. In the end, he was compensated by Mr. Trump for about $24,000 of legal work for the campaign and donated thousands more dollars\u2019 worth of services as an in-kind contribution.   Mr. Garten said he saw many of the attacks on Mr. Trump as an attack on the company. It was his job to fight back, he said.   The president-elect\u2019s deliberations over how to separate himself from his company coincided with one of its oldest and most celebrated traditions.   Jill Cremer, a former vice president at the Trump Organization, fondly recalls company Christmas parties at the Plaza Hotel, the Pierre or the Rainbow Room. Mr. Trump would hand out prizes \u2014 airline tickets, luggage, cameras \u2014 and would pose with employees for photos.   \u201cThe Christmas party was always the highlight,\u201d Ms. Cremer said. \u201cIt was a real family affair.\u201d   This year, the celebration fell on Dec. 14, two nights after Mr. Trump said he would  postpone announcing  the details of his plan for the stewardship of the company.   He was facing a flurry of activity, including making cabinet picks and navigating calls with foreign leaders, but he found the time to stop by the atrium of Trump Tower, where the party has been held in recent years.   As hundreds of Trump Organization employees and guests nibbled on steak from Trump Grill and sipped wine from Trump Winery, Mr. Trump thanked the crowd for helping build the company that bears his name.   \u201cYou could see the love in the room,\u201d Eric Trump said.",

   "6. description": "SOCHI, Russia \u2014 A Russian aircraft bound for  Syria  carrying a famed military band to entertain Russia\u2019s forces there crashed into the Black Sea moments after takeoff on Sunday, and the authorities said all 92 people aboard were believed dead.

The military plane, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154, disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from the resort town of Sochi. Russia\u2019s official weather forecast agency said that conditions near the airport were \u201cnormal, easy,\u201d the Interfax news agency reported. The airplane was technically fit, the Defense Ministry said.   Wreckage of the plane, which was carrying 84 passengers and eight crew members, was found in the sea, most of it about one mile from shore, the Russian Defense Ministry said. No survivors have been found at the crash site, Russian officials said.   Passengers on the flight, which originated in Moscow and stopped in Sochi to refuel, included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, the Russian military choir, who were traveling to Russia\u2019s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The band planned to serenade Russian personnel in Syria on New Year\u2019s Eve.   President Vladimir V. Putin deployed Russian armed forces in Syria in September 2015, ostensibly to fight terrorism but primarily to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, the leader of the lone remaining Russian ally in the region, whose forces have been fighting an insurgency for nearly six years.   Russian forces have been instrumental in helping the Damascus government regain the initiative, with the final rebels  expelled from  the besieged city of  Aleppo  on Thursday.   Three journalists from Channel One, Russia\u2019s main television station, were on the plane, as were journalists from the Zvezda and NTV television networks, news reports said.   Yelizaveta P. Glinka, a prominent Russian philanthropist and a member of the presidential council on human rights and civil society, was also on the list of people on board. Mr. Putin recently honored Mrs. Glinka with a state award for  her human rights and charity work . Valery V. Khalilov, the ensemble\u2019s artistic director, was also on the plane, according to the list of passengers.   Mr. Putin expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims, and he declared Monday a national day of mourning. (Christmas is not celebrated as an official holiday in Russia on Dec. 25, because the  Russian Orthodox Church  observes it on Jan. 7.)   \u201cFirst of all, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families of our citizens, who died today, as a result of an aviation catastrophe over the Black Sea this morning,\u201d Mr. Putin said in St. Petersburg, according to remarks published on the Kremlin\u2019s website.   He also ordered Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev to establish a state commission, headed by the transportation minister, Maxim Sokolov, to investigate the crash. The Defense Ministry said that 11 bodies had been recovered as search efforts continued, Russian news agencies reported.   A memorial was installed inside the Sochi airport, and people brought candles and flowers. Relatives of the victims were whisked away by the authorities to a specially designated zone where they were treated by psychiatrists.   Mr. Sokolov told journalists inside the terminal building that the rescue effort would not stop at night.   \u201cIt is premature to say anything about the causes of this tragedy,\u201d he told reporters.   More than 30 vessels were deployed in the recovery operation, Mr. Sokolov said, and the Defense Ministry said that more than 100 divers had been sent to the crash site.   Founded in the Soviet era, the Alexandrov Ensemble, which had performed in Syria earlier this year, is the official band of the Russian armed forces. It consists of an orchestra, a choir and a dance ensemble, and is one of the two Russian orchestras allowed to use the title Red Army Choir.   The ensemble was founded by Aleksandr V. Aleksandrov, a prominent Soviet composer and the author of the music of the Russian anthem. His grandson Yevgeny told Meduza, a Russian news website, that \u201cthe best members of the ensemble died.\u201d   \u201cAll the best soloists, the whole choir,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything will collapse now. The best ones are gone.\u201d   Several independent news outlets in Russia reported that the Alexandrov Ensemble had planned to give a concert in Aleppo. In May, the Russian military had flown a symphony orchestra  led by one of its best -known conductors ,  Valery Gergiev , to mark the reclaiming of Palmyra.   Until recently, the Tu-154, which was designed in the 1960s, was one of the most widely used civilian aircraft in Russian aviation. The plane that crashed on Sunday was made in 1983, underwent planned maintenance work in the fall, and was operated by an experienced pilot, the Defense Ministry said.   Russian airlines have mostly replaced outdated Soviet planes with new ones in recent years and have vastly improved the overall safety record. Many government agencies continue to fly the Tu-154 and other old Soviet aircraft, however.   The age and reputation of the Tu-154, as well as the fact that the aircraft had flown out of secure military airfields, meant that most senior officials speaking publicly ruled out the possibility that an attack had caused the crash. But there was speculation by a few aviation experts, echoed by some officials, that terrorism could not be ruled out given the suddenness with which the plane disappeared and the size of the debris field.   \u201cFor us the worst version is an act of terrorism, because if this is the case, this will mean that we have paid another bill for Aleppo,\u201d Vadim Lukashevich, an aviation expert, told Dozhd, an independent television station.   In one of Russia\u2019s most recent air disasters, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for planting a bomb onboard a Russian civilian Airbus that crashed in Egypt in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board in a flight from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik to St. Petersburg.   Another Russian-made military plane crashed in eastern Siberia on Monday , seriously injuring 16 of the 39 people on board, and the aviation authorities recently  grounded the country\u2019s newest civilian airliner , the Sukhoi Superjet 100, because of concerns about metal fatigue.",

   "7. content": "NORTH POLE, Alaska \u2014 Miners huddled around them to stay warm through the long, cold nights in the Klondike gold rush of the 1800s. Artists have enshrined them in paintings and tourist curios. For many people in America\u2019s far north, the old-fashioned wood stove \u2014 crackling and radiant, and usually cast-iron black \u2014 is as Alaskan as it gets. But many Alaskans also see their home state as a natural wonderland, where the expectation of bracingly pristine air is just as deeply ingrained.   Winter has arrived here in a town where St. Nicholas Drive intersects North Santa Claus Lane, and the streetlight poles are painted to look like candy canes. That means wood-fired stoves, interludes of cough-inducing smoke and vehement arguments about who is to blame. It is the season of light, and also the season of soot.   \u201cThat guy has got an old stove, right there,\u201d Dr. Jeanne Olson, a veterinarian and air quality volunteer, said on a recent afternoon, pointing from the cab of her four-wheel-drive Toyota toward a spiraling column of thick gray smoke from a homeowner\u2019s chimney. The thermometer inside Dr. Olson\u2019s cab said it was 30 below zero outside, which meant that lots of people in the vicinity were probably putting another log on the fire, or thinking about it, even as she spoke.   Air pollution in winter is different from the ground-level ozone smog that hits cities like Los Angeles in summer. Air over the Salt Lake Valley in Utah can turn a sickly yellow in January. Agricultural areas like the Cache Valley in southern Idaho and the San Joaquin Valley in California can be socked in by chilly, pollution-laced fog. Residents of Beijing are suffering this month through one of that city\u2019s  worst stretches of air pollution  in a year.   But here in one of the coldest parts of the coldest state, there is an only-in-Alaska pollution story: At about minus 20 Fahrenheit \u2014 a fairly regular occurrence here in winter \u2014 smoke that goes up comes right back down, to linger at ground level and, therefore, lung level. The average from 2013 to 2015 for dangerous small-particle pollution, called PM 2.5, which can be deeply inhaled into the lungs, was by far the highest in the nation in  North Pole , just southeast of Fairbanks, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.   \u201cIt\u2019s all one thing \u2014 when you most need the heat is when you\u2019re most apt to create a serious air pollution problem for yourself and the people in your community,\u201d said Tim Hamlin, the director of the office of air and waste at the E.P.A.\u2019s Region 10, which includes Alaska.   And forces are now converging to heighten the tension in this seemingly unlikely pollution story. Civil fines by Fairbanks North Star Borough \u2014 which includes the cities of Fairbanks and North Pole, with a total population of about 100,000 \u2014 could be assessed in coming days against residential polluters. The E.P.A. could declare the entire area to be in \u201cserious\u201d noncompliance of the  Clean Air Act  early next year, with potentially huge economic implications, including a cutoff of federal transportation funds.   Some residents said they feared that an overreaching government, locally and in Washington, was out to take away their stoves. Others, like Dr. Olson, who works with racing sled dogs in her veterinary practice and volunteers with  Citizens for Clean Air , a local group that has sued the E.P.A. to force a decision on Fairbanks pollution, said the exact opposite.   The government, Dr. Olson said, has been endangering public health by dragging its feet. For six consecutive days in mid-December, the air here was declared \u201cunhealthy,\u201d for high particulate content \u2014 the longest streak since the current monitoring system began in late 2015, according to the borough\u2019s  air q uality d ivision.   \u201cBoth sides are digging in their heels,\u201d said the borough\u2019s mayor, Karl Kassel, who has been calling residents to chat about their heating systems and to urge them to upgrade, with  financial help  from the borough, to more efficient wood stoves. \u201cWe have been settieng ourselves up for a crescendo.\u201d   Certainly, no one from the E.P.A. or in local government is saying this part of Alaska is universally polluted. The problem, they say, is often block by block or street by street, because in the deep cold inversions, particulate pollution settles to the lowest areas in a basin surrounded by hills. Fairbanks North Star Borough is about the size of New Jersey, most of it wooded, wild and dazzlingly beautiful in winter.   \u201cWe have a weather problem, we have inversions here that trap air, and it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be solved,\u201d said Lance Roberts, a member of the Borough Assembly.   Residents are also trapped, he said, by economics. Natural gas, a much cleaner fuel source, is not widely available in this part of Alaska, and  heating oil  can be very expensive. Oil also produces particulate pollution, though less than wood. A study for the borough last year said residents here spent, on average, almost four times the national average in annual heating costs.   \u201cPeople up here tend to be more independent,\u201d Mr. Roberts added. \u201cThey came up here to get away from the regulatory environment that\u2019s down in the lower 48, so they definitely see the E.P.A. as coming after wood stoves and trying to cut out that kind of independent lifestyle where you can live off the grid.\u201d   Mr. Hamlin, the E.P.A. official, said his agency was definitely not trying to take away anyone\u2019s wood stove, or make life more expensive. But he said the Clean Air Act, passed by Congress in 1970, requires a standard of breathable air for all Americans. The E.P.A. was given the job of enforcing that standard.   \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be telling people what to do, but the standard is what it is, and we want to work with you to be able to get there,\u201d he said.   Critics of government intervention, led by a local representative in the Alaska Legislature,  Tammie Wilson , said they were ready to fight back with a lawsuit if the borough started fining homeowners for smoke violations, especially if their homes are far from the monitor that is recording air quality in the community. The North Pole  air monitor  regularly records some of the highest local concentrations of particulate pollution in the nation.   \u201cThey\u2019re allowing themselves to be bullied by the E.P.A.,\u201d said Ms. Wilson, a Republican. \u201cAnd there\u2019s going to be an uproar. We already have a big group of people who will make sure there is money to take it to court so that we can finally prove that the way they\u2019re doing air quality doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d   Some residents are taking action on their own. Morgan Boatman said he had begun to understand local air quality problems more deeply in chatting with Dr. Olson, who cares for his dogs at her veterinary clinic. Last month, he shut down his old boiler system and had a high-efficiency masonry furnace installed in its place, at a cost of about $25,000.   \u201cI\u2019m not big on government, and I think there\u2019s a lot of overreach, but I\u2019m trying to be a good steward,\u201d he said. \u201cI see now that there is a problem.\u201d",

   "7. content": "Montel Williams has slammed the four people who allegedly attacked a mentally disabled man, and has called for them to spend the rest of their lives behind bars.   The beating was captured on cellphone video by one of the assailants and has since been viewed millions of times on social media.    The graphic footage shows the suspects taunting the victim with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump.    On Thursday, the television personality wrote on Facebook that the thugs can no longer be trusted in society, and deserved the harshest punishment.   'Life in prison. No parole. I'm not interested in whether these kids had a tough life, whether their parents loved them enough, I don't care.   'Whether this is a hate crime is a distraction and irrelevant - THIS IS THE COLD BLOODED TORTURE OF AN INNOCENT HUMAN BEING.'    Scroll down for video    He wrote: 'My prayers go out to the young man in this disgusting video.'   On Saturday, Williams said in a video posted on Facebook: 'I thought I might take just a minute to amplify what I'm talking about, when I say that this Chicago crime was a crime against humanity.   'Let's remember that yes it is a hate crime, and most people are thinking about that because of race, but this was a person who was less than fully capable as the rest of us.   'I don't want to use the term handicapped, but that's what we say. This young man was differently abled, and one of the least of us.   'And let's also remember while we are thinking about this, that there's a movement afoot to take away care from people like him by completely destroying the Affordable Care Act.   'Let's remember people like him need that as protection, and need that protection expanded. So while we talk about inhumanity, let's remember the least of us.'   He also wrote on the social media site: 'This is a serious crime - the hate crime, the racism is almost irrelevant in light of the cold blooded torture of another human being - that's on a whole different level, and the fact this young man is differently able and was unable to fight back is the final straw justifying the most serious punishment available under the law.   'Plenty of people grow up in the hood - myself included - the notion that's an excuse for torturing another human being disgusts me.'   A Chicago judge refused to allow the suspects caught on cellphone footage taunting and beating a mentally disabled white man to post bail and leave jail, saying they are accused of such 'terrible actions' that they are a danger to society.   'Where was your sense of decency?' Cook County Circuit Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked them on Friday during their first court appearance, sounding baffled that the suspects could be charged with such cruelty toward the 18-year-old victim.    Prosecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the mother of the victim, who is schizophrenic and has attention-deficit disorder.    They also said the beating started in a van when the same attacker became angry that the mother had contacted him asking that her son be allowed to come home.   A prosecutor told the judge that the suspects forced the victim to drink toilet water, kiss the floor and then allegedly stuffed a sock into his mouth and taped it shut as they bound his hands with a belt.   The four are charged with two counts of committing a hate crime - one because of the victim's race and the other because of his mental disabilities.   On the video, the male suspects use knives to cut the victim's hair and his sweatshirt. One of the females can be seen laughing. A female also laughs as she punches the victim.   One of the men pulls the cord from the victim's sweatshirt around the victim's neck and holds him up while the victim groans in pain, according to a document read in court.    The victim can be heard screaming when one of the men walks up to him with a knife and asks if he should 'shank' him.   At one point, the prosecutor said, someone on the video can be heard saying that he did not care if the victim was schizophrenic.   The four suspects were identified as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago.   They stood quietly as the prosecutor read the allegations. Some of their relatives also listened, including a woman who wiped tears from her eyes.   Defense attorneys portrayed the suspects as hardworking, responsible and religious. Cooper, for example, takes care of his twin brother, who is in a wheelchair. Tanishia Covington has two small children. Her sister attends college and has a job. Hill, the judge was told, goes to church with his grandmother.   All four have experienced brushes with the law, some for serious and violent crimes.   Hill, for example, was arrested as a juvenile in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers.   Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped.   The uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing.    The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon.   The incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential campaign that split the nation. Some conservatives suggested it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection.   The incident began New Year's Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald's, and then called his parents later to say he was staying with Hill for a sleepover.   Instead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, police said.   The victim's parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The victim eventually escaped and a police officer spotted him wandering down a street, bloodied and disoriented.",

Her husband adds: \u2018Never did I imagine that in West Hollywood I\u2019d become father to John\u2019s little miracle baby brother.   \u2018It\u2019s a wonder of modern science that the Longleat Bath family has been completed (for now at least) by Emma and I having a much-loved son, helped so crucially by a tremendous surrogate in California, to extend our family.\u2019   Henry is named after his great-grandfather, the 6th Marquess, who caused a scandal after the Second World War when he opened the Longleat house and gardens to the public, before later creating the country\u2019s first safari park.   Ceawlin, 42, and 30-year-old Emma have already made history \u2013 the Viscountess is the country\u2019s first black British aristocrat following their 2013 marriage. He will one day become the Marquess of Bath and she his Marchioness.   But that achievement, which came in the face of prejudice and in some cases downright hostility, is nothing to the struggle she has undergone to have a second child.   As the couple explain today, their choice of surrogacy is the result of a terrifying brain illness suffered by Emma during her first pregnancy in 2014, when doctors warned that having a second child could kill her.   At what has been their temporary home since Christmas, a six-bedroom mansion in Beverly Hills, the couple have decided to share their story to help take the stigma and mystery out of a process which may cause unease in the strait-laced circles of the aristocracy.   \u2018We have certainly been worried about how people will react to the news,\u2019 says Emma. \u2018I just want them to know this is not about my vanity or that I was too lazy. I\u2019m not the kind of person who would have done this for anything less than a very important reason.   \u2018I didn\u2019t care about my weight gain or that breast feeding would ruin my body. I just want to live to see my children grow up. I did not want to take the risk of something tragic happening. I really enjoyed being pregnant up until the point when the terrifying pains began.\u2019   Relaxing on a sofa in a reception room with a spectacular vista of sprawling LA, she gently cradles the sleeping newborn as she recalls the trauma of her first pregnancy.   The problems began when Emma was diagnosed with a disorder of the pituitary gland, which left her with searing pain she describes as \u2018like a knife stabbing at my brain\u2019.   The memory clearly still overwhelms her. \u2018I had never known such pain,\u2019 she reveals. \u2018It was beyond anything I could imagine.   \u2018I tried everything to alleviate it, but often ended up lying in a dark room trying not to move. Even breathing too hard was agony.\u2019   The headaches \u2013 which started in the summer of 2014, during her third trimester \u2013 were manageable with painkillers until the family was on holiday in the South of France. There, her symptoms escalated.   \u2018I was more worried about the baby than myself,\u2019 she continues. \u2018It was so upsetting to be that ill. It hurt so much that I threw up and Ceawlin called an ambulance.\u2019   Doctors at the local hospital thought the pain was hormone-related. But once back in Britain, Emma\u2019s symptoms got progressively worse. She tried various treatments \u2013 including wearing a neck brace \u2013 but nothing worked.   Emma says it felt as if she was bleeding in her brain, which is exactly what an MRI scan revealed.    Although doctors initially suspected a non-cancerous tumour, she was diagnosed with a rare but serious condition called hypophysitis, involving swelling and bleeding, which can cause a stroke during a \u2018traditional\u2019 birth.   Ceawlin, seated beside his wife, takes up the story. \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t understand hypophysitis very well at all, but they knew it was potentially fatal,\u2019 he says.   \u2018They had to inject Emma with steroids to help develop the baby\u2019s lungs, as they prepared for an emergency C-section three weeks before her due date, because her life was at risk from a natural birth.   \u2018It was a very worrying time, especially as no one could really tell us much about the condition.\u2019   As it was, Emma underwent months of tests even after John was born safely, and is still being monitored by doctors because of the growth on her brain, which though small has not disappeared.   She has had ten MRI scans in the past two years, but does her best to ignore the anxiety.    \u2018I try not to think about it because the doctors don\u2019t know what to do,\u2019 she admits.   Yet they had always wanted two children. \u2018Ceawlin and I had talked about it from the start,\u2019 she continues. \u2018We thought two was a good number because we wanted John to have a brother or sister.\u2019   Which meant the only choices were adoption \u2013 or the seemingly radical step of surrogacy.   They opted for surrogacy because two family friends had done it. \u2018They said it was wonderful,\u2019 recalls Emma. \u2018We also took advice from friends who were doctors.\u2019   They settled on California, again after a recommendation.   Ceawlin explains that the US state has the most advanced legal system for the procedure.    For example, it allows money to be exchanged, while Britain insists no more than expenses can be paid to the woman who will carry the child.   \u2018Obviously, we would have preferred to do it closer to home, but the legal system in Britain has not evolved with medical technology, so any contract with a surrogate is not binding,\u2019 he says.   \u2018Even if the baby is 100 per cent yours (ie the sperm and egg) the surrogate still has the right to keep the baby. California has the most evolved legal system in the world [for surrogacy].\u2019   They flew in to meet with the agents of a commercial surrogacy firm in September 2015 and were told at the consultation that there was a willing surrogate available. There was no selection process.   Not long afterwards, they met the woman, who had three children and, says Ceawlin, they \u2018clicked immediately\u2019. \u2018She was young and healthy. It was her first surrogacy and she was eager to help. We liked her very much.\u2019   As the months passed they kept in touch by Skype, and have met her natural family. \u2018I think we\u2019ll always have a connection,\u2019 Emma says.   \u2018We are so appreciative about the gift she has given us. But I always felt it was our child she was looking after for us. We were just grateful someone was so generous as to give up so much of their lives for us.   \u2018It will be an important life lesson for Henry to learn when he is older and we tell him what we went through to have him.\u2019    Which was a great deal, including an intense medical regime to synchronise the two women\u2019s menstrual cycles and \u2018tons and tons\u2019 of drugs, to increase Emma\u2019s eggs for harvesting and in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Six weeks later they found they had a number of embryos to choose from.   \u2018We naturally chose the healthiest one,\u2019 continues Emma. \u2018It turned out to be male, but it was not planned. Yes, we wanted to know the sex, but it didn\u2019t really matter. We just wanted the strongest one.\u2019   Despite frequent trips to America, they managed to keep the process private, telling people they were on business. Indeed, until a couple of months ago, they had told only close friends and family, fearing something might go wrong.    However, they wouldn\u2019t say if \u2018family\u2019 includes Ceawlin\u2019s father, the colourful Marquess of Bath or his mother, both of whom snubbed the couple\u2019s wedding in 2013, held at Longleat.   Lord Bath has expressed great displeasure at Ceawlin\u2019s modernisation of Longleat since he took control of the estate in 2013, which involved removing a number of the Marquess\u2019s prized erotic paintings from the main house.   Emma\u2019s side of the family did know about the surrogate pregnancy. Her sister Samantha and her mother, Suzanna McQuiston, flew to LA to support the couple as they waited for the birth, which had been expected just before Christmas.   Emma and Ceawlin were both present when, finally, Henry arrived. \u2018It was amazing and very emotional,\u2019 says Emma. \u2018We cried with happiness and I felt the love immediately, as I had with John.\u2019   They had planned to take the baby home that night, but he was not feeding properly and had a slight case of jaundice.    Though not in danger, it was decided to monitor him overnight. Instead, the couple celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve at the clinic with two-year-old John meeting his new brother the next morning.   \u2018We had talked to John about the new baby and so he was as excited as us when we took him home,\u2019 she says. \u2018He smiled the biggest smile ever and could hardly wait to touch his baby brother.   \u2018It has been the perfect start to the New Year. Having my first baby was wonderful, but I\u2019m now much more confident and my state of mind much better.   \u2018I\u2019d forgotten how tiny new babies are. With John, I was so ill and frightened \u2013 I felt overwhelmed.   \u2018The fear made me worry about him so much that it was crippling. I became an insomniac and worried about everyone falling ill. It was disturbing to feel so completely out of control of my body, especially as I had always been very healthy.\u2019   The joy shines out of face as she cradles Henry, who is burrowed into her chest and makes mewling sounds in his sleep.   \u2018I felt so guilty not being able to carry him myself \u2013 what mother would not wish to do so?\u2019 she says. \u2018This time around I am able to enjoy the pleasure of being a mother without any shadows.   \u2018I feel very lucky and blessed. I know I\u2019m very fortunate to be able to afford it.\u2019   Emma, the daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon and an English mother, says that she had hoped the arrival of a grandson could help heal the rift with Lord Bath and his wife.   That does not appear to have happened.   But with a dozen of her unused eggs in storage, there may be more chances to promote harmony at Longleat House, where both sides live in separate wings.   \u2018Who knows how we will feel in the future?\u2019 says Ceawlin. \u2018Of course it would be another surrogacy and we would want it to be a daughter.\u2019   But for now, Lord and Lady Weymouth are content with just the two, who will ensure a 400-year line succession continues, if not quite smoothly, then uninterrupted.",

The loved-up prince is set to take Meghan away skiing, which may soften the blow of her delayed humanitarian trip to India.    She has been forced to delay the trip to India for charity work amid security concerns now that she is dating a prince.   The actress was due to fly there later this month with children's charity World Vision, for whom she is an ambassador.   She is currently with Prince Harry on a romantic break in Norway.    A source told the Daily Star : 'This will be Harry and Meghan\u2019s first ski holiday together, which to ski bunny Harry is a big deal. It\u2019s not just the skiing, the whole apres ski social aspect is right up his street.   'Obviously his uncle Andrew\u2019s chalet in Verbier is preferred by his protection team because they know every inch of the land, but Harry\u2019s love affair with Norway is only deepening after his time with Meg there at New Year.'   Harry is said to be deciding the exact location for the trip, thought to be happening in February, but is taking advice from close friend Inge Solheim, a polar explorer who has given him advice on previous trips.   It could also be a chance for her to meet his friends as they are said to have been invited to come along on the trip.    The holiday will likely come after Meghan's postponed trip to India.   A source told the People : 'The trip has had to be put back due to organisational concerns.   'Since Meghan's relationship with Prince Harry became public knowledge, her profile has risen dramatically and that brings a lot of things with it.   'It has not been rescheduled for any definite date yet but it is not expected to happen now until at least March.   'Meghan is disappointed her India trip has been put back, but she understands why.    'Dating Harry has changed her life dramatically, but she couldn\u2019t be happier.'   Meghan had spoken about the planned trip in October, before her relationship became public, and said she was looking forward to setting up a 'girls' programme' that she'd been working on for six months.   The couple celebrated the new year together before flying out to Tromso, on the Norwegian fjords, where they also whale watched and enjoyed romantic lake trips.   And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of their first trip away together was looking up into the night's sky at the Aurora Borealis.   They are thought to have bonded over their shared love of humanitarian work, which Meghan has written about on her blog The Tig.   She wrote: 'I\u2019ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches \u2013 I\u2019ve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.'   When she was last on a trip with World Vision, to Rwanda, in February Meghan visited clean water projects, helped build a well and met many Rwandans who have had a lasting impact on her life.   The actress does admit that balancing a life of luxury to one where she witnesses people denied of the most basic needs can be challenging.   She adds: 'Guiding my heart though the swinging pendulum from excess to lack of access is sometimes challenging.'",

Neither Linda nor Graham has yet been identified but dozens of people have spotted the posters around the town, and shared pictures of them to social media.

Posting another picture of one of the signs in a different location, Mark Hebert said: 'Posters all over Warwick . Naughty Graham.'   Andrew Robins also tweeted a picture of one of Linda's posters, writing: 'Saw these all over Warwick today.

Although some social media users were quick to point that Linda could have broken the law by maxing Graham's credit cards and throwing away his keys, others commended her actions.    Jeanette Mason commented on one of the pictures, writing: 'So funny. Most of us wouldn't have the nouse or the nerve. Good on ya girl.'   And Julie Dingley said: 'Well done Linda. Who needs a cheat as a partner!'    The professional-looking posters were erected by a company called Throwing Rocks, which offers a service placing '50 high quality poster boards in a location specified by you.'   Although some have suggested Linda's revenge may be an publicity stunt, on Twitter the company was adamant the posters were genuine, saying their website had been included at the bottom as a 'way of letting you know who provided the service.'

   "7. content": "Last week we learned that ambulance-chasing \u2018no win, no fee\u2019 lawyers are sucking \u00a3440 million out of the  NHS  every year.    That\u2019s just their share of the loot. Lawsuits in total cost the Health Service more than \u00a31.5 billion a year.   Any visitor to NHS hospitals knows that these cynical firms are allowed to advertise their \u2018services\u2019 in the public areas of hospitals themselves. In effect, the NHS has to help people to ruin it.   There is no need for any of this. It all stems from a crazy mistake made back in the 1990s by Margaret Thatcher and John Major.   Almost everyone who understood the subject was against introducing no win, no fee lawsuits at the time, including senior judges and distinguished lawyers.   They warned that it would \u2018Americanise\u2019 our legal system. And they were dead right. I can remember, as long ago as 1982, watching Paul Newman playing a deadbeat US lawyer in The Verdict.   The opening scene showed Newman hanging round funeral parlours, wretchedly handing his business card to the mourners of accident victims, in the hope of getting a case, any case.   At the time, I had no idea this went on. Later, during many visits to the US and while living there in the early 1990s, I discovered the hideous truth. Nobody, anywhere, was safe from a mad lawsuit which might well succeed.   I was warned, for instance, that if a guest in my house merely spilled hot water on himself, I could well face a gigantic lawsuit and lose it.   From this came the cringing, hyper-cautious \u2018health and safety\u2019 culture which dogs the supposed land of the free (and now dogs us too). Not to mention much higher costs for almost everything, as insurers raise their premiums to finance the incessant, huge payments.   Who, knowing this, would introduce this Bloodsuckers\u2019 Charter in a country that didn\u2019t have it? We did. A Royal commission had opposed it. The Law Commission didn\u2019t like it.   It was excoriated by experts and laymen alike in the House of Lords, where it was attacked by the late Lord Rawlinson for introducing \u2018ambulance-chasing\u2019 in which lawyers acted \u2018like vultures\u2019.   Journalists and newspapers aren\u2019t always very nice. I have been on the receiving end of my trade\u2019s less lovable features, during a (long-ago) family tragedy, and so I know this better than most reporters.   That\u2019s why I\u2019m not inclined to be pious about press freedom. We scribblers are never going to end up commemorated in stained-glass windows. Like many important parts of a free society, our liberty is a two-edged sword.   But you\u2019ll miss it once it is gone. There is, literally, nobody else with the power to take on big government and big corporations. They talk to us (and try ceaselessly to bamboozle and cajole us) because they are afraid of us.   And if they weren\u2019t, they would be greedier, more incompetent, lazier, and more crooked than they are.   Thomas Jefferson, one of the founders of the USA, a man who understood the cynicism and untrustworthiness of politicians very well, because he was a politician, put it best. \u2018Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.\u2019   Now, lesser men and women are quietly building a coffin for press freedom in this country. Some of them have had their own nasty actions exposed by newspapers. Others just don\u2019t like seeing opinions they don\u2019t share given a powerful platform.   There is still time to stop them, but it is very short.   Thanks to a foolish law passed by David Cameron, the Culture Secretary, Karen Bradley, can by a stroke of her pen bring back that ancient wrong, state regulation of newspapers, under the threat of bankruptcy for those who don\u2019t comply. Please write to her, as soon as you can, urging her not to do so.   But Mrs Thatcher went gaily ahead with this Bloodsuckers\u2019 Charter, more politely known as the 1990 Courts And Legal Services Act (Section 58).   This cleared the way for the change, but was fitted with a time-delay device \u2013 perhaps because the Government was ashamed of it and didn\u2019t want to be linked with it when it eventually took effect.   It was finally activated in 1995 by the passage of the Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations. In a last-ditch attempt to stop it, which failed by only six votes, the late Lord Ackner warned \u2018there will be occasions when this country will exceed the worst excesses of the United States\u2019.   He noted that the original Bill had been \u2018enacted in the teeth of opposition from seven Law Lords, the Master of the Rolls, a former Lord Chancellor, my noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham, a former Attorney-General, the noble and learned lord, Lord Rawlinson of Ewell and the Law Commission\u2019.   The clear reason for the measure was to save money on legal aid, which is of course a very costly way of trying to see that justice is open to those who are not rich. But, as we now see, it was a false economy. The NHS\u2019s annual legal bill of \u00a31.5 billion is only slightly less than the \u00a31.7 billion which legal aid cost the whole country in 2014-15.   And that is just the NHS. Who can count the extra costs loaded on to every other public body, from schools to the Army, and on to every private company, by the need to guard against opportunist lawyers scouring the country for plaintiffs seeking a payout?   In the catalogue of mistakes made by governments, this is a pretty big one. But it is also quite easy to put right. Who would weep, apart from the legal vultures, if we abolished no win, no fee and went back to legal aid for reasonable cases? It would obviously cost less in the long run.   My guess is that nothing happens because most people still blame the loopy \u2018Health and Safety\u2019 culture, wrongly, on human rights laws or political correctness.    It has nothing to do with them. It can\u2019t even be blamed on Anthony Blair, who was indeed a disaster but didn\u2019t wreck the country all by himself. It was just a stupid mistake. Theresa May has the sense to reverse it, and should do so.   They've taken a bite out of Mars    There's a technique for raising prices without drawing attention to it, known in the food trade as \u2018shrinking the chocolate bar\u2019.   The bar gets smaller. The price stays the same. The poor consumer quite possibly doesn\u2019t notice.   This has all got much easier since the state-sponsored attack on customary British weights and measures, our old landmarks and signposts.   Who knows what a gram is, or feels like? But I know the feel of four ounces of toffees in the palm of my hand, just as I know what it means when someone measures five feet nine inches tall, but have to look it up when he says he is 1.7526 metres.    Now that fine body the British Weights and Measures Association (BWMA) has spotted a very odd change in the Mars Bar, once two ounces (or 58 grams).   In 2014 that went down to 51 grams. Only the keen-eyed would have noticed that this was even a change.   The BWMA cheekily wrote to Mars asking why they couldn\u2019t put the weight of their bars in ounces as well as grams on the wrapper.   The company said (incorrectly) that the figure in grams was more accurate. Now it turns out that Mars Bars made in metric Holland do give the weight in ounces and grams, clearly showing that the weight has been reduced to 1.80oz.   I wonder why they can\u2019t do that on the bars they make in Britain, where so many of us still think in English measures?",

In an email to his staff, he urged them to challenge politicians\u2019 \u2018ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking\u2019 and \u2018deliver messages that are disagreeable to those who need to hear them\u2019.   He warned the UK would be outmanoeuvred by the EU in Brexit talks because \u2018multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in Whitehall, and that is not the case in the commission or in the council\u2019.   Sir Ivan admitted his departure would add to officials\u2019 \u2018uncertainty\u2019 and that no one knew what \u2018the Government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU after exit\u2019.   Appointed by David Cameron in 2013, he had been due to step down in October this year but said he was leaving early so a new \u2018top team\u2019 could be in place to handle the triggering of Article 50 this year and the negotiations over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU that will follow.   But Sir Ivan had already angered Brexiteers by claiming last month that it could take up to a decade to agree a new trade deal with the EU.   A Foreign Office spokesman said last night: \u2018Sir Ivan Rogers resigned as UK Permanent Representative to Brussels on January 3. He did not seek any further Civil Service appointment and has therefore resigned from the Civil Service with immediate effect.   \u2018We are grateful for Sir Ivan\u2019s work in Brussels and across a number of other senior positions in the Civil Service.\u2019 He will receive three months\u2019 pay in lieu of notice but no pay-off.   Leading Remainer Tory MP Anna Soubry said a Government Minister should have defended the impartiality and professionalism of civil servants during the row over Sir Ivan\u2019s departure. And she warned that the Prime Minister must not \u2018shoot the messenger\u2019 by falling out with officials who have to give her bad news.   She said: \u2018There is a paucity of advice to Theresa May. Prime Ministers who rely on a tiny clique of people will fail.\u2019   The warning came as pro-Brexit Tory MP John Redwood accused pro-Brussels Whitehall mandarins of betraying Ministers in talks with EU leaders.   He said that as a Trade Minister involved in EU negotiations in the 1990s, he found the rug pulled from under his feet when civil servants gave away his negotiating position.   \u2018There were times when I was given minimum objectives to secure\u2026 only to find someone unknown had passed our bottom line to the European Commission or other EU members,\u2019 Mr Redwood said.",

The team was on a bus driving down the same highway en route to Baton Rouge for its Saturday game against Louisiana State University when the accident occurred.   Players and coaches witnessed the accident and yelled to stop the bus.     Howland, director of operations Michael Moynihan and strength coach David Deets pried Ashley from the car by opening a back door on the driver's side.    After being examined by the team's trainer Ryan Dotson, Ashley did not appear to have serious injuries.    Ashley was found upside down in the car and unconscious until Deets 'pounded on her door' before she began crying out for help.   Howland told players to stay on the bus in case another car slid on the road.       'We were worried this thing was going to explode. It was really scary', Howland said.   She waited on the team's bus until an ambulance arrived.    'It's really a blessing she walked away from that', said Howland, who called to check on the woman before the game. 'The car was totaled. I'm really thankful we weren't seeing something that was more of a disaster. Wearing her seatbelt saved her life'.    The team took a bus from Starkville, Mississippi, to Baton Rouge on Friday for the game because its airplane de-icing machine malfunctioned.   On Saturday, the Bulldogs beat Louisiana State, 95-78.     An estimated 73 million Americans from as far north as Maine and as far south as Mississippi are under winter weather storm warnings, according to  NBC .",

Close to Regent\u2019s Park, it is one of three luxury homes the couple shared during their five-year relationship.    Most recently, George stayed at his 16th Century cottage in Goring-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he died.    While in London, they mainly spent time at his \u00a318 million mansion in Highgate.   How long Fadi can remain at the mews house is unclear. So too is whether he is in line for a slice of the singer\u2019s \u00a3105 million fortune.   Either way, Mr Fawaz has come a long way from his humble upbringing in Logan Central, Queensland, where unemployment rates are twice the Australian national average.    His mother Nada remains at the family home and has been in regular contact with her son since he found himself at the centre of global interest following the tragedy.    Mr Fawaz is due to be questioned for a second time by police as they try to piece together the former Wham star\u2019s last movements.   For now, the cause of death is unexplained, although there is suspicion he may have suffered a drugs overdose.    Mr Fawaz, meanwhile, has still to publicly explain contradictory statements he made in the aftermath of Michael\u2019s death.   Asked how her son was coping with the media storm, Nada said: \u2018I am very sorry but you will understand I can\u2019t speak about this.\u2019   Over the past week, Mr Fawaz has been comforted by his brother, Nabil, an Amsterdam-based hairdresser. Yesterday Nabil said: \u2018Everything will come out in the end. My poor brother is devastated. He is broken. The whole family has been destroyed by what is happening.\u2019     Asked how Mr Fawaz was coping, he replied: \u2018My brother, he is sad. He is devastated. He is \u201ckapoot\u201d as they say in Holland. He is broken.\u2019   He added: \u2018My poor brother is talking too much now.\u2019   After leaving Logan in 2003, Fadi Fawaz, who was born in Lebanon, moved first to Sydney where he worked as a male model, before switching to London.   At one point he worked as a porn model \u2013 though he denies this \u2013 and his relationship with Michael is said to have begun some years later.",

Wendy's asked Fort Worth PD to direct message them with more information about the incident so they could properly investigate.   The conflict seems to have been resolved as of yesterday afternoon after the chain met with the police department and 'confirmed their support for law enforcement'.    Fort Worth PD posted an update again on Twitter thanking Wendy's - ending the tweet with the hashtag '#wendysbackstheblue'.   Evidently, Twitter is the best platform to reach the chain.   They've made headlines recently with their quick one-liners and witty retorts in response to trolling tweeters.   Their official account frequently chats with fans and jokes with those who put down the restaurant, but they generally respond to any service complaints formally.",

Uninjured, Mr Pettifor got out of his car \u2013 and so did the other driver.   'I immediately noticed that he stank of drink,' says Mr Pettifor. 'He then got back in the car and tried to restart it, but the damage was too great.   'His girlfriend was in the front passenger seat, and he yanked her out and they both scarpered.'   When police arrived, Mr Pettifor gave his side of the story. As with any accident, the officers had to keep an open mind as to whose fault it had been. But in this instance they were armed with a powerful piece of evidence that showed exactly where the blame lay \u2013 video footage from Mr Pettifor's dashboard camera, or 'dash cam'.   'The police saw it right there and then and they instantly knew it was not my fault,' says Mr Pettifor. 'It showed that I hadn't been speeding or driving badly. It ruled all that out, and entirely proved my innocence.'   Better still, when it came to dealing with the normally time-consuming and frustrating business of making an insurance claim, the footage was equally useful as it comprehensively proved the Astra driver was at fault.   'His insurers had nothing to argue with,' Mr Pettifor says. 'They couldn't say I was veering around, and the video shows their driver speeding straight through a Give Way sign.'   As a result, the insurers swiftly agreed to pay out, thereby saving Mr Pettifor much time and hassle over having to establish who was at fault.   He says: 'Do I think all cars should have dash cams? Put it this way, I will always have one. They're essential when dealing with any sort of dispute.'   Those of us unlucky enough to have spent weeks, if not months, wrangling with insurance companies in the wake of an accident will look upon Mr Pettifor's experience with an envious eye. Although car crashes can often be traumatic, many people find that the bureaucratic aftermath can be even more upsetting.   Dash cams, with their unimpeachable record of any incident, are therefore becoming increasingly popular, and it looks certain that 2017 will see thousands of us forking out for a device that may soon become as ubiquitous as the satnav.   It is now common for police to appeal for dash-cam footage following serious accidents \u2013 they did so after a pile-up on the A40 near Witney in Oxfordshire a few days after Christmas.   It is estimated there are already about 840,000 dash cams \u2013 including helmet-mounted cameras for motorcyclists \u2013 on the roads in the UK. In 2015, the last year on record, sales increased by a massive 395 per cent, making dash cams the fastest growing category in consumer electronics. Globally, it is estimated that the market for them will triple to some \u00a34.5 billion a year by 2022.   Already, many professional drivers fit them as standard.   Yet while there are plenty of motorists who are convinced dash cams really do make life easier in the event of an accident, others believe they are the thin end of a disturbing wedge, in which insurance companies and law-enforcement agencies will be able to gather and collect data about yet another aspect of our private lives.   Just because a device is popular, does that make it necessary? Should every car really have a dash cam?   Before trying to answer that, it's worth getting to know exactly what one does.   A dash cam is a small camera in a unit fixed to the dashboard or windscreen that records the road ahead. Images are saved on an internal memory card \u2013 a budget model with a 32GB card will film a four-hour trip.   Many units have screens allowing instant playback. If necessary, footage can be transferred to a computer and saved, and in the event of an accident, the film can be viewed.   Some more complex dash cams record other data, such as speed, exact location and even G-forces, all of which can help to build up a terrifically accurate picture of the circumstances of any accident. Typically, these more complex dash cams are connected to a vehicle's electricity supply via the fusebox, while the simpler versions are powered through a cable that runs to the 12-volt socket.   Dash cams are certainly not expensive. The cheapest models can be as little as \u00a330, with the priciest running to some \u00a3300. However, it is not necessary to spend much more than about \u00a3150. The essential feature to look out for is video quality. The cheapest cameras may be tempting, but there is little point in recording an accident only to find that the image of the other vehicle speeding away from the scene is too grainy for the number plate to be readable.   If you do splash out, you may get your money back in the form of a cheaper motor insurance policy.   AXA, for example, offers ten per cent off insurance premiums for new and renewing customers with a dash cam.   The thinking is that if you're involved in an accident that is not your fault, the dash cam makes it easier for your insurer to prove that, and not to have to agree to a fifty-fifty split with the other insurer.   An AXA spokesman said: 'If a claim is settled on a 'non-fault' basis, your no claims discount is unaffected and your insurer can usually recover your policy excess \u2013 this could you save hundreds of pounds.'   Another company offering dash-cam discounts, sometimes as high as 20 per cent, on its insurance policies is Markerstudy.   The group's underwriting director, Gary Humphreys, said: 'Dash cams save us a huge amount of time. With a normal claim, it can take us about eight to 12 weeks to exchange details with the other insurer, and to agree liability. If we have dash-cam footage, we can turn the whole thing around in about 72 hours. That's a huge difference, and we can pass on the savings to our customers by offering discounted policies.'   Such cameras clearly also save the police an enormous amount of time, and make it easier to track down drivers who have left the scene of an accident. That's what happened to Hemang Sheth who, in November, was knocked off his motorcycle at a roundabout at Canary Wharf in London, by a driver who then sped off.   'I was lying in the middle of the roundabout, and she drove around me,' Mr Sheth recalls. 'In fact, nobody stopped at all!'   The police arrived shortly afterwards, and Mr Sheth was able to show them the video footage from his helmet cam on his laptop in the back of the squad car. 'Luckily, I had passed the car in traffic just 30 seconds before the crash, and I got a good view of the number plate,' he says.   'The police were instantly able to get her address, and within an hour they had gone round to her house. She admitted everything.'   As well as quickly establishing fault, many dash-cam owners say the cameras make them better drivers. Among them is David Doyle, from Manchester, who was in his car when he was smashed into at a road junction by a driver who ran through a red light. The camera instantly showed the police that he was not to blame, and Mr Doyle says the camera has another benefit.   He explains: 'Having a dash cam makes me a lot more considerate and cautious. You're well aware that you can incriminate yourself if you drive badly, and because you're aware it's there, it calms you down a bit.'   Simon Marsh, the managing director of VisionTrack, a leading supplier of dash cams, agrees.   'I think people with dash cams drive more responsibly,' he says. 'When you know you're being recorded, you slow down, and that extra second can often help you avoid an accident, or lessen its impact. You drive more defensively, because you also know that you can be judged on your driving.'   Some dash cams, such as the VisionTrack VT2000, even offer a function called 'telematics', which can report the data gathered by the dash cam in real time back to a computer at home.   'This is invaluable if you're a parent keeping an eye on young drivers,' says Mr Marsh.   'You can set up an alert that reports directly back to you if the driver has exceeded the speed limit, or has been involved in a crash.   'My personal opinion is that all cars should have dash cams. The case for them is just so strong, especially with the benefits they can bring with insurance claims. It's a no-brainer.'   Gary Humphreys regularly uses this function when his children \u2013 now aged 21 and 18 \u2013 are on the road.   He says: 'Once, I saw that my son had been speeding, so when he got home, I sat him down, showed him where and when he had done it, and told him he'd be paying for his own insurance if he did it again. Funnily enough, he hasn't done so since.'   Of course, the fact that dash cams can effectively spy on drivers does raise the issue of privacy. Although drivers are perfectly entitled to film the road as it is a public space, some may feel that these cameras, if they do become ubiquitous, will act as little Big Brothers in our cars.   AXA says it treats dash-cam footage 'with the same degree of sensitivity as other claims-handling data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998'. But as we know, even big internet firms can fall prey to hackers. And how long before police demand footage?   Markerstudy says (as with AXA) its policy-holders are not obliged to hand over footage in the event of a crash, but if they do not do so, it is possible their policy excess can be raised.   So long as insurers respect the data gathered from the dash cams, it is hard to see the downside. Perhaps the real question then is not whether you can afford to buy a dash cam \u2013 but whether you can afford not to.",

Detectives were able to nab Lubin thanks in part to his Instagram account, where he posted a photo of himself wearing the same 'distinctive white hooded sweatshirt with black horizontal lines' that the suspect wore in security footage of the Masbeth robbery.    Lubin posted a photo of himself on Instagram next to a pile of cash.    In the Ozone and Masbeth robberies, Lubin allegedly passed demand notes on bank deposit slips to the tellers, claiming he was 'heavily armed' and to 'put $5,000 in an envelope'.    Notes further advised the tellers not to 'piss [him] off' and that 'everyone\u2019s safety depends all on you!'    He pocketed $1,000 in cash during the Ozone heist and $5,000 from the Masbeth branch.    Lubin reportedly was handed the money at both locations without ever brandishing a weapon.  Police said he made off with a total of $25,000.    Detectives were able to recover his fingerprints from his demand notes.   Lubin's most recent robbery took place on Jan 4 at the Chase branch at 3528 East Tremont Ave in the Bronx. There he allegedly stole between $6,000 and $7,000, police said.   The suspect's crime spree is reported to have begun on Sept 30 when he allegedly robbed a Chase branch in Kew Gardens Hills.   He is also a suspect in six bank robberies that took place in Florida between 2004 and 2013, according to police.",

Rebekah Mellon plead guilty to first degree murder in the death of her husband at their home in Phoenix, Arizona.   Mellon shot her husband Donald in their living room on July 31, 2012, then sat on their L-shaped couch and smoked a cigarette for the 17 minutes that he lay dying.   The entire altercation was captured on the couple's home surveillance system, as reported by  Az Central.   After she hot him, footage shows Mellon sit on the L-shaped couch and light up a cigarette.   It also shows Donald Mellon covered in blood and crawling into the frame and lifting himself off the floor onto the couch.    Six minutes after he did so, his wife called the police.    Had medical examiners gotten to Donald sooner, he likely would have survived the injuries.   Before seeing the video, Az Central reports that the defense was looking to plead guilty to manslaughter charges, which would have gotten her a sentence of seven to 10 years.    Mellon suffered years of domestic abuse charges at the hands of the man she murdered, and the defense planned to use that as the reason for her break.     However, after seeing the footage, Maricopa County Supreme Court Judge told Mellon that she should accept a plea bargain.   She said: 'Jurors will never have seen something like that.    'Someone willing to sit in the same room with someone and patiently let him die.'    The outlined plea saw Mellon plead guilty to second-degree murder, receiving a sentence of at least 20 years, Az Central reported.    Rebekah Mellon suffered years of domestic violence and abuse at the hands of her now late husband.    Were the case to go to trial, Mellon's attorney Jennifer Willmott would bring up the acts of violence committed by Donald against his wife, to show that Mellon's actions were in self-defense, reported Az Central.    The 'reasonable person' standard in Arizona has been in place since 1992, and requires that juries take into account self-defense and situations such as abuse.    The standard does not say what constitutes, but gives the jury the ability to decide 'how a reasonable person would act if that person had been the victim of those domestic-violence incidents', according to Az Central.    However, due to the video footage and Mellon's intoxication during the incident, attorneys encouraged the defendant to accept the 20-year plea bargain.",

The bombshell footage, covertly filmed in a London restaurant and obtained by The Mail on Sunday, shows a senior diplomat making the astonishing threat to target Sir Alan Duncan.

The video comes in a film claiming to expose the way that the Israeli government has \u2018infiltrated\u2019 both the  Conservative  and  Labour  parties via its embassy in the UK, using secret cash and covert support.   Further footage shows the Israeli diplomat, intelligence expert Shai Masot, telling senior Labour MP Joan Ryan that he has obtained \u2018more than \u00a31 million\u2019 to pay for sympathetic Labour MPs to visit Israel.   Mr Masot also mocks \u2018crazy\u2019Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his \u2018weirdo\u2019 supporters. Footage shows pro-Israel Labour activists discussing the Jerusalem government\u2019s secret role in backing their activities.   Last night it emerged that Israeli ambassador Mark Regev had made a full apology to Sir Alan for Mr Masot\u2019s \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019 comments.   And a spokesman for Boris Johnson said: \u2018The Israeli ambassador has apologised and made it clear to us that these comments do not represent the views of the Israeli Embassy or government.\u2019   The revelations follow Tory infighting over the party\u2019s policy on the Israel-Palestine dispute, and repeated claims of anti-Semitism among Labour\u2019s Leftwing \u2018Corbynistas\u2019.   Senior Tory MPs have condemned the apparent threat to \u2018take down\u2019 Sir Alan \u2013 who has been critical of Israel and who is described in the secret footage as causing \u2018problems\u2019 \u2013 and called for a Downing Street inquiry.   Former Tory Minister Sir Desmond Swayne condemned Mr Masot\u2019s \u2018disgraceful\u2019 comments, adding: \u2018To talk of \u201ctaking down\u201d a British Minister is very sinister.   \u2018There is anger in the US at Russia\u2019s meddling in its democratic process and no such foreign meddling should be allowed in the UK.\u2019   He was backed by Crispin Blunt, Conservative chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, who is also targeted by Masot in the film. He called the alleged comments about Sir Alan \u2018outrageous\u2019.   The disclosures are in a film made by the investigative unit of the Qataribased Al Jazeera TV company, which claims to show how the Israeli Government has \u2018infiltrated\u2019 the Conservative and Labour parties.   But Lord Stuart Polak, senior director, of the Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), said last night: \u2018It is utter nonsense to assert that any UK political party is taken over by any organisation.   \u2018The Friends of Israel groups do their job of educating their members about the complicated issues in the Middle East. The Israeli Embassy represents Israel in a professional manner.   \u2018To suggest they are involved in anything sinister is poppycock.\u2019   One pundit claimed that Britain\u2019s recent support for a UN Security Council vote condemning Jewish settlements on the West Bank undermined the claim that the pro-Israeli lobby dictates UK foreign policy.   However, days after the vote, Theresa May angered Palestinian supporters by attacking US Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s claim that the current Israeli Government is the \u2018most Right-wing in its history\u2019.   An undercover reporter and hidden cameras tracked Mr Masot across Britain as he held secret talks with figures from CFI and its Labour counterpart (LFI).   His apparent threat to \u2018take down\u2019 Sir Alan was made a month later at the Aubaine restaurant, directly opposite the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, West London, where Masot is based.   Also present was Maria Strizzolo, senior aide to Education Minister Robert Halfon, former political director of CFI.   After Ms Strizzolo boasts about her role in making Halfon a successful Minister, Mr Masot asks her: \u2018That\u2019s obvious, but can you do the opposite stuff as well?    Can I give you some names of MPs that I would suggest you take down?\u2019   When Ms Strizzolo replies that all MPs \u2018have something they\u2019re trying to hide,\u2019 Mr Masot says: \u2018I have some MPs\u2019 and tells the undercover reporter: \u2018She knows which MPs I want to take down\u2026 the Deputy Foreign Minister [Duncan].\u2019   He says Sir Alan \u2013 a well-known critic of Israel, and Boris Johnson\u2019s second-incommand \u2013 is \u2018doing a lot of problems\u2019.   He appears to suggest that Sir Alan is more powerful because Johnson \u2018is an idiot with no responsibilities. If something real happened\u2026 it will be Duncan.\u2019   Strizzolo says Sir Alan is \u2018impossible to rebuff\u2019 and has powerful \u2018friends and claims that in a bitter clash over Israel with her boss, Sir Alan \u2018threatened to destroy\u2019 Mr Halfon.   \u2018Rob told the Whips and they told him [Halfon] to calm down,\u2019 she says. Strizzolo then suggests: \u2018A little scandal maybe?\u2019 adding: \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone about this meeting.\u2019   Ambitious Mr Masot\u2019s CV has the hallmarks of a spy: he spent eight years in the Israeli Navy\u2019s \u2018Special Unit\u2019, has a degree in International Affairs, worked in Israeli Defence intelligence, has the rank of major and recently applied to run Israeli Foreign Affairs intelligence.   He says that he is \u2018not a career diplomat\u2019 and came to the UK \u2018to take care of specific political issues \u2013 that\u2019s what I do\u2019.   Mr Masot also says he missed out on a job in the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, joking: \u2018It was a huge fight\u2026 me and another candidate... I tried to kill him but it didn\u2019t work.\u2019   In a discussion about other \u2018pro Arab\u2019 Tory MPs, Mr Masot refers to Crispin Blunt, who, like Sir Alan, has criticised Israel.   Ms Strizzolo chips in: \u2018On the hit list? Yeah!\u2019 adding she \u2018cannot stand [\u2018pro-Arab Tories\u2019] \u2013 they\u2019re horrible people... the two go together.\u2019    The target and his 'idiot' boss:  The Israeli diplomat targeted pro-Palestinian Deputy Foreign Secretary Sir Alan Duncan, not 'idiot' Boris Johnson   The Israeli agent provocateur:  The diplomat Shai Masot, pictured at the Labour conference with Israeli ambassador Mark Regev, says he 'takes care of political issues'   The fixer with a score to settle:  Mario Strizzolo is an aide to Robert Halfon, ex-political director of Conservative Friends of Israel, who had a bust-up with Alan Duncan    \u2018Arab apologists,\u2019 comments Mr Masot.   Both Mr Halfon and Ms Strizzolo are prominent supporters of Conservative Friends of Israel.   Shortly after Mr Halfon was made an Education Minister by Theresa May last year, Ms Strizzolo, his former Commons chief of staff, became a civil servant at the Education Department and continues to work part-time for him at the Commons.   In the film, she boasts of how she and the CFI ensure Tory MPs offer vocal support for Israel, for example by preparing public statements for them.   \u2018If you do everything for them it\u2019s harder for them to say, \u201cI don\u2019t have the time... I won\u2019t do it,\u201d \u2019 she said.   She says she phoned Mr Halfon from Israel and \u2018convinced\u2019 him to ask a question to David Cameron in support of Israel in Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the Commons in 2014.   When Mr Masot asks: \u2018Did he do it?\u2019, Ms Strizzolo replies: \u2018Yeah, and [obtained] a Government statement.\u2019   The film also shows how Mr Masot had intensive contact with pro-Israel Labour figures and discussed extra funding for LFI at the party\u2019s conference in Liverpool in September.   He tells the group\u2019s chairman, Ms Ryan, of plans for \u2018another delegation of LFI activists\u2019 to visit Israel.   Ms Ryan responds: \u2018That\u2019d be good. What happened with the names we put in to the embassy, Shai?\u2019   Masot: \u2018We\u2019ve got the money, more than \u00a31 million, it\u2019s a lot of money.\u2019   Ryan: \u2018It must be.\u2019   Masot: \u2018I have got it from Israel. It is an approval.\u2019   Ryan: \u2018I didn\u2019t think you had it in your bag!\u2019   Last night, Ms Ryan said the claims in the film were \u2018rubbish.\u2019   Mr Halfon and the Israeli embassy declined to comment.   Ms Strizzolo said last night her conversation with Masot was \u2018tongue-in-cheek and gossipy\u2019, adding: \u2018Any suggestion that I\u2026 could exert the type of influence you are suggesting is risible.\u2019   She knew Mr Masot \u2018purely socially and as a friend. He is not someone with whom I have ever worked or had any political dealings beyond chatting about politics, as millions of people do, in a social context.\u2019   Sir Alan also declined to comment.            Edited transcript of meeting between Shai Masot (M), senior political officer, Israeli Embassy, London, Maria Strizzolo (S), leading pro-Israel Tory activist and an aide to Conservative Minister Robert Halfon, and an undercover reporter (R).   M: Can I give you names of MPs I suggest you take down?   S: If you look hard enough I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something they\u2019re trying to hide.   M: Yeah. I have some MPs.   S: Let\u2019s talk about it.   R: Yeah.   M: She knows which MPs I want to take down.   S: Yeah, it\u2019s good to remind me.   M: The Deputy Foreign Minister [Duncan].   S: You still want to go for it?   M: ...He\u2019s doing a lot of problems.      S: Really?   M: Really. It sounds like a conspiracy.   S: I thought you had neutralised it a little bit?   M: No. Boris. He\u2019s basically good.   S: He\u2019s solid on Israel.   M: Yeah. He just doesn\u2019t care. He is an idiot but has become Minister of Foreign Affairs without any responsibilities. If something real happened it won\u2019t be his fault... it will be Alan Duncan.   Duncan is impossible to rebuff... he has a lot of friends.   S: Years ago, Rob [Halfon] was asking questions in Parliament about terrorist salaries...   M: When he [Duncan] was a DFID minister?   S: Yeah. He [Duncan] told him [Halfon]: if you don\u2019t stop this I\u2019m going to destroy you and all of that s***.  Rob told the Whips and they told him to calm down. So never say never.   M: Never say never, yeah but...   S: A little scandal maybe? Don\u2019t tell anyone about this meeting.   M: Who would we tell? Masot and Strizzolo on \u2018horrible anti-Israel\u2019 Tory MPs.   M: Crispin Blunt [chairman of Commons Foreign Affairs committee]. Those are people you...   S: ...On the hit list? Yeah!   M. I don\u2019t have any problems with them.   S: Some super pro-Arabist [Tory MPs]\u2026 I can\u2019t stand [them], They\u2019re horrible people - the two go together.   M: Yeah\u2026   'Poisonous conduct is a disgrace':  Minister who served in David Cameron's government says it is time to end the problem of Israel buying UK policy   Last month Theresa May, like David Cameron each year before her, spoke to the annual lunch of the Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI).   She oozed praise for Israel as a democracy, spoke of the constant terrorist threat they face, and condemned the way that Palestinians supposedly incite violence and anti-Semitism.   Her own policy that considers Israeli settlements on Palestinian land illegal received only a passing mention.   The reason is clear: the Conservative Party wants pro-Israel donors\u2019 money, and principle in the Government\u2019s foreign policy has been relegated.   Matters deteriorated further over Christmas after US Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s forceful condemnation of the extremism and conduct of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Israeli government.   Instead of agreeing with his comments \u2013 which are identical to her own policy \u2013 she criticised Kerry.   Behind this inconsistent and concerning attitude lies a serious and troubling problem. British foreign policy is in hock to Israeli influence at the heart of our politics, and those in authority have ignored what is going on.   For years the CFI and Labour Friends of Israel (LFI), have worked with \u2013 even for \u2013 the Israeli government and their London embassy to promote Israeli policy and thwart UK Government policy and the actions of Ministers who try to defend Palestinian rights.   Lots of countries try to force their views on others, but what is scandalous in the UK is that instead of resisting it, successive Governments have submitted to it, taken donors\u2019 money, and allowed Israeli influence-peddling to shape policy and even determine the fate of Ministers.   Even now, if I were to reveal who I am, I would be subjected to a relentless barrage of abuse and character assassination.   The CFI is not affiliated to the Conservative Party. It is incorporated in a way that means it is not to transparent about donors. Yet it arranges for the support of MPs and funds regular visits to Israel which distort the truth. Cameron turned a blind eye to Israeli misconduct \u2013 if he ever cared about it \u2013 because he was persuaded any criticism would reduce Party donations.   It now seems clear people in the Conservative and Labour Parties have been working with the Israeli embassy which has used them to demonise and trash MPs who criticise Israel; an army of Israel\u2019s useful idiots in Parliament.   This is politically corrupt, and diplomatically indefensible. The conduct of certain MPs needs to be exposed as the poisonous and deceitful infiltration of our politics by the unwitting agents of another country, which acts in defiance of international law, and whose government Kerry called its most extreme ever.   We need a full inquiry into the Israeli Embassy, the links, access and funding of the CFI and LFI, and an undertaking from all political parties that they welcome the financial and political support of the UK Jewish community, but won\u2019t accept any engagement linked to Israel until it stops building illegally on Palestinian land.   This opaque funding and underhand conduct is a national disgrace and humiliation and must be stamped out.",

They are fighting for something we in Britain take for granted: the right to free expression that is a foundation stone of our democracy.   Small wonder, then, that many journalists in foreign countries look with envy on a place where politicians cannot dictate the public agenda, where censors do not hold sway and where reporters are free to investigate wrongdoing without fear.   So they would be shocked to discover that Britain, the mother of parliamentary democracy, faces the threat of politicians muzzling the press.   We stand on the brink of permitting a self-protecting political class to impose a state- sanctioned regulator \u2013 and incredibly, devolving official approval to a body funded by the embittered son of a wartime fascist who ended up on the front pages in a sex scandal.   As human rights groups such as Index on Censorship point out, if such measures were introduced in other countries, British politicians would be the first to scream about dreadful state censorship.   They are right. This draconian measure threatens to protect crooks and dodgy characters while shackling investigative journalism, silencing small publishers and shrinking public accountability of those in power.   I have reported from more than 50 nations, covering coups, conflicts and chaos, and have witnessed first-hand what it is like to operate in regimes where such restrictions are in place.   From Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe, I have been privileged to work with journalists who risk their lives and liberty daily to defy authorities in pursuit of stories. They challenge powerful forces with fierce courage and a determination to fight for democratic values. Several have ended up in jail. Azerbaijan\u2019s superb investigative reporter Khadija Ismayilova was convicted on phoney embezzlement charges after exposing a series of dodgy dealings by her president\u2019s family.   In Swaziland I met an editor named Bheki Makhubu, outspoken over the appalling regime of Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch. He spent 15 months in prison after later criticising the conduct of his country\u2019s chief justice.   Others have been forced to flee for safety in the dead of night, such as one reporter I know from Ethiopia. Only last week two more journalists in that repressive state were jailed for trumped-up terrorist offences, joining 16 others behind bars.   They would rightly look on in amazement as Britain sleepwalks towards a future in which the press freedoms they so desire are shackled by state intervention and the threat of crippling legal costs for those who dare to report the truth.   Consider the facts. Four years ago Westminster was still smarting from the fallout over its shameful expenses scandal, which was revealed by a national newspaper and led to criminal convictions for several MPs. Then along came a phone-hacking scandal, sparking anger over the antics of some red-top journalists, and the subsequent Leveson Inquiry that gave politicians the opportunity for revenge.   A cosy deal was cooked up between the three main party leaders \u2013 all since ousted from office \u2013 and members of Hacked Off, an anti-press lobby group whose best-known figure is film star Hugh Grant.   So now comes Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Acts, snuck through Parliament in just 13 hours despite some MPs complaining of voting on an unseen draft, which empowers a regulator called Impress to oversee publishers, who will otherwise be denied justice in the courts.   This new body is funded by the family of Max Mosley, whose sexual activities were once splashed in the now-closed News of the World newspaper.   This is back-door imposition of state control on the press.   And if that was not bad enough, an official regulator sanctioned by Parliament is getting cash from a rich man crusading to rein in papers after he was caused embarrassment. Indeed, there is tragic irony in the Government giving recognition to a state body funded by the son of Sir Oswald Mosley \u2013 not least when it is egged on by people who call some of Britain\u2019s most popular daily newspapers \u2018fascist\u2019 and want them banned.   But it gets worse. Much worse. The most alarming aspect of this move is that it threatens to end the freedom of journalists to expose wrongdoing, investigate errant behaviour and hold the powerful to account. Publishers can choose whether to accept Impress\u2019s authority. But if they refuse, they would be forced to pay all legal costs if a story is challenged in the courts for libel or on grounds of privacy \u2013 regardless of the outcome.   Welcome to a world in which journalists and newspapers are punished \u2013 and possibly forced out of business \u2013 for telling the truth about crooks, thieves and scoundrels. What other law, what other civilised country, acts in such a manner?   This would have a very real and damaging impact on serious journalism. For example, last month I revealed how Britain\u2019s biggest specialist aid contractor obtained secret and sensitive state papers for commercial advantage. Adam Smith International also tried to hoodwink a parliamentary inquiry into fat-cat firms creaming off cash intended for the global poor.   This was a tricky story given the high stakes involved, and it has since led to two official inquiries and a Ministerial intervention. There was a whistleblower needing protection, discussion over legalities of leaked documents, threats of a court challenge, internal debate on public interest concerns. After 30 years reporting and editing newspapers, this is familiar terrain.   Yet in this chilling new world of state control, that wealthy firm could have sued us despite evidence stacked against it, secure in the knowledge that all legal costs would be recoverable. This malign measure threatens to crush investigative journalism, starting with smaller publications and local newspapers struggling for survival in the digital age.   It is particularly perilous for Sunday papers, which have run some of the most important investigations over recent decades, because last-minute injunctions are especially damaging for a publication coming out just once a week.   And it is simply astonishing this is suggested at a time when malevolent states are waging cyber-attacks designed to disrupt Western democracies, provoking justified fears over the destabilising impact of false news flying around social media.   Senior sources at Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news network, are deeply alarmed by what is happening here. If British investigative journalism, which they regard as the best in the world, can be stifled in this way, what will be the consequences in the Gulf states, still ruled by feudal-style monarchies?   If Theresa May is on the side of decent people, as she proclaims, this destructive legacy of her predecessor\u2019s era must be swept aside when public consultation concludes on Tuesday.   Journalists are troublemakers by nature, yet for all the undoubted sins of my profession, we need people prepared to rake through muck to stem any stench of corruption.   This foolish proposal would propel Britain into the ranks of nations that permit stifling state control of the press. This might please the rich and powerful. It would definitely delight the dodgy and the dubious. But it would demean a democracy that for all its faults remains a beacon of light in some of the world\u2019s darkest corners for its cherished tradition of press freedom.",

The damaging effects last for up to four years, the study showed. After that, health starts to improve as workers adapt to their new roles.   The findings contradict earlier studies which suggested career success reduced the risk of heart disease over the subsequent 15 years.    Experts now think promotion may trigger adverse effects on health in the short term but prove beneficial in the long run.   Stockholm University researchers studied 1,400 men and 2,000 women in Sweden for six years.    Nearly two-thirds reported no job promotions between 2008 and 2014, but nearly 700 were promoted once, 367 twice and 139 three times.    And nearly 50 got moved up the career ladder four times.   The volunteers were asked to rate their general health on a scale ranging from \u2018very good\u2019 to \u2018very bad\u2019. They were also asked questions designed to gauge their levels of depression.   Those promoted within the previous two to four years were more likely to report declining health. Men were more likely to suffer mental health problems, while women were more prone to work-induced physical illness.   The researchers told the International Journal Of Epidemiology: \u2018Job promotion is associated with decreased self-rated health and increased depression in both men and women for up to four years.    'But health may start improving again four to eight years after the promotion.   \u2018It may have a negative health effect only in the short term.\u2019   Professor Sir Cary Cooper, an expert in organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, said: \u2018Being promoted often means longer hours and greater responsibilities \u2013 which can take a toll on your health until you eventually adjust to it. Not everyone is suited to promotion.\u2019",

Brig Beardmore held the German post, responsible for the health services of thousands of British troops and their families, for two years and recently moved to London as a general staff officer. The MoD refused to say which position the charges relate to.   Brig Beardmore is expected to attend the initial hearing in Colchester, Essex, on January 19.   The Mail on Sunday understands he is the only person charged in relation to the alleged fraud.   There are just 150 brigadiers in the British Army, senior to colonels and outranked only by generals. Their starting salary is \u00a3101,147.   Brig Beardmore was promoted to his present rank in 2014. He is hugely respected within the RAMC as an expert on treating battlefield casualties and planning large-scale medical operations supporting troops in war zones. He is also a leading fundraiser and president of the Penguins Against Cancer charity, set up in 2013 by rugby-playing doctors at Guy\u2019s Hospital.   The charity has raised tens of thousands of pounds for specialist hospital wards and cancer research centres. Brig Beardmore\u2019s wife Charlotte, 53, is also a trustee of the charity, according to its website.   The last British Army brigadier to appear before a court martial is thought to have been \u2018Mad\u2019 Mike Calvert, one of the most highly decorated commanders of the Second World War.   Brigadier Calvert, who was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Order after fighting the Japanese behind enemy lines in Burma, was found guilty of \u2018gross indecency with male persons\u2019 in 1952 \u2013 15 years before homosexuality was decriminalised.   The former Royal Engineers and SAS officer vigorously denied the indecency charge until his death in 1999, insisting that top brass had wanted to get rid of him because he was unconventional and a heavy drinker.   In 2007, Colonel Jorge Mendonca of the Queen\u2019s Lancashire Regiment became the most senior officer in recent times to be court-martialled. He was cleared of negligently performing a duty after his soldiers were found responsible for the death of Iraqi civilian Baha Mousa in Basra in 2003.   The MoD said last night: \u2018We do not comment on ongoing cases.\u2019",

But one woman who helped Mr Spirescu after he arrived in the UK says her kindness has been repaid with subterfuge, debts and excuses. On one occasion, Mr Spirescu even told her that women were not his equal.   Single mother Anne Brown took Mr Spirescu into her home after her daughter Zoe, 22, met him last summer. He said he had nowhere to live, having been kicked out by his girlfriend \u2013 Romanian-Cypriot Suzana Mates, also 22.   Zoe then fell for Mr Spirescu and the pair became a couple. But while Zoe would shortly find herself broken-hearted when Mr Spirescu returned to his ex, her mother was left counting the cost of her encounter with this citizen of the new, expanded Europe: \u00a3879, to be exact.   For, unbeknown to her, during his six-week stay at her house in Hendon, North London, Mr Spirescu used the address to register his car.   After he left in September, there followed a stream of parking fines and official letters, culminating last month in a visit from bailiffs demanding money following an accident \u2013 one that Zoe believes happened while Mr Spirescu was on the phone to her, having a blazing row.   Having, perhaps unwisely, invited the bailiffs in for a cup of tea, baker Mrs Brown said they refused to leave without fulfilling the court order awarding the money to the other party involved.   \u2018I phoned Victor,\u2019 said Mrs Brown, 55. \u2018He spoke to one of the bailiffs and said he didn\u2019t live here any more, but that wasn\u2019t good enough. So I settled the debt after Victor had promised to pay me back.   \u2018He came around that evening with Suzana and promised he\u2019d pay me back, but was waiting for some money to come in.   \u2018In the following weeks, Zoe was surprised to see his Facebook posts about days out he was enjoying with Suzana and reminded him of his obligation to me \u2013 telling him not to forget the people who helped him when he had nothing.   \u2018But now he won\u2019t answer his phone. In one text, just before Christmas, he told me that he was Romanian and that women were \u201cnot equal\u201d with him and we should remember that.\u2019   There\u2019s no doubt that Mr Spirescu\u2019s Facebook page is designed to impress. There are endless photographs of him and London-based business student Suzana on trips to Amsterdam, Paris and Cyprus. The pair have also visited Oxford, Bournemouth and Windsor.   Mr Spirescu was welcomed by Labour MP Keith Vaz when he arrived from Romania, and declared he wanted to \u2018work, earn money and go home\u2019.    He started by cleaning cars but, according to his subsequent media updates, he has exceeded those expectations thanks to a thriving air-conditioning business and a glamorous girlfriend.   He claims to have earned \u00a362,000 in 2015, and \u00a358,000 last year, and has bought a fleet of cars and enjoyed plenty of exotic travel.   When The Mail on Sunday caught up with Mr Spirescu last week, he was again on holiday with Suzana \u2013 this time in Berlin.   When asked about Mrs Brown and her debts, he told our reporter that her claim was \u2018b******t\u2019.   \u2018I never crashed a car,\u2019 he claimed. \u2018I gave her that car, a Renault Espace. I never received paperwork from her telling her she was liable for this so-called accident. Why would she not show me?\u2019   Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday state that Mr Spirescu is the registered keeper of the car \u2013 but at Mrs Brown\u2019s address.   He did admit to moving into Mrs Brown\u2019s home with Zoe for two months.   \u2018I slept in a single bed in a single room with her and paid her mother \u00a3100 a week\u2019 \u2013 although Mrs Brown claims it was \u00a380 a week.   He added: \u2018This woman is just greedy. I am going to sort it out with her when I get home.\u2019",

   "7. content": "NHS  hospitals serving millions of people are completely full, with no beds for new patients, shocking official figures reveal.   In the weeks running up to  Christmas , more than a dozen hospitals across England faced turning away critically ill patients because they were running at 100 per cent capacity.   Experts say anything over 85 per cent occupancy is dangerous.   One hospital, the Princess Alexandra in Harlow, Essex, did not have a single bed free in any general or acute care ward for 27 days in December.   Another, the North Middlesex in Edmonton, North London, was full for 23 days.   The damning statistics, seen by this newspaper, are contained in an official NHS report, and are the starkest indication yet how the Health Service is struggling in the face of its worst nationwide crisis in 15 years.   The news comes after it emerged that:   The Red Cross has warned that NHS hospitals across the country face a \u2018humanitarian crisis\u2019, while doctors warned last night that hospitals were close to \u2018meltdown\u2019.   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also weighed in to the crisis, demanding that the Prime Minister come to the Commons tomorrow to explain the \u2018scandal\u2019.   Disturbingly, the disclosures about packed wards comes as The Mail on Sunday also reveals stark new evidence that hospital overcrowding is linked to high numbers of unexpected deaths.   Our painstaking analysis shows that the 16 hospital trusts in England which had \u2018higher than expected\u2019 death rates last year were on average more likely to be seriously overcrowded than the 16 trusts with \u2018lower than expected\u2019 death rates.   Experts say the beds crisis has been triggered by drastic shortfalls in social care funded by local councils, leaving fewer carers for frail and elderly people recovering from illness, and fewer care home beds.   These patients consequently languish on hospital wards for longer, meaning there are no beds available for people coming through A&E.   Last night Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Health Select Committee, said bed occupancy rates were \u2018far too high\u2019, putting hospitals under \u2018immense pressure\u2019.    And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, warned: \u2018Meltdown is an emotive term but what is undoubtedly true is that emergency departments and hospital staff are absolutely working at their very limit \u2013 and that\u2019s not sustainable.   \u2018NHS staff are incredibly dedicated, but they are human beings and they can\u2019t carry on working at 110 per cent with hospitals full, emergency departments overcrowded, and ambulances queuing up for prolonged periods outside.    'What we are seeing is the safety net of the NHS being stretched to the absolute limit, and in some places it\u2019s breaking.\u2019   He said bed occupancy rates should ideally be no higher than 85 per cent, explaining: \u2018When you get to 100 per cent that\u2019s when you get patients stuck in emergency departments for 10, 15, 24 hours or more.\u2019   The two deaths on A&E trolleys occurred at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital. One was a 93-year-old woman who had been waiting on a trolley for up to 35 hours and then suffered a heart attack. She could not be placed on a ward due to a lack of beds.   Last night a hospital spokesman said the A&E corridor where she had been placed was an \u2018integral\u2019 part of the department staffed by doctors and nurses.   He added that the elderly patient did not die in a corridor but in a hospital cubicle.   Dr Hassan said: \u2018I am absolutely sure there are many other cases of patients waiting for prolonged periods of time on trolleys.   \u2018Long waits in emergency departments are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.\u2019   Hospitals across England started to become exceptionally busy within days of the formal start of winter on December 1. On December 5, 11 NHS trusts running 15 major hospitals and serving more than 4.5 million people declared they had no beds free at all.    In the South, these included Epsom and St Helier hospitals in South London, East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, and the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford. In Essex, Basildon, Thurrock and Princess Alexandra hospitals were full.   St Mary\u2019s on the Isle of Wight was completely full, as was Southmead Hospital in Bristol.   Across East Anglia and the Midlands, the Norfolk and Norwich was at 100 per cent, as was George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton, Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Kidderminster Hospital and the Worcestershire Royal. In the North, Barnsley Hospital had no free beds.   Hospitals should have no more than 85 per cent of beds occupied at any time.    But in December, the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, did not have a single spare bed for 27 out of 31 nights, making it the fullest hospital in England.   The 383-bed facility was full for nine days at the start of the month, then there was a two day lull when five beds briefly became available, followed by another 12-day stretch at full capacity until Christmas.   With patients discharged on Christmas Eve, and no pre-planned operations carried out over the break, occupancy dropped briefly.    But the hospital was full again from Boxing Day to New Year\u2019s Eve.   December 5 was just the start of an incredibly busy period which only eased at Christmas because routine operations do not take place over the festive break.   On December 6, eight trusts running ten hospitals were at 100 per cent capacity.    The following night nine trusts running 12 hospitals were totally full. The situation peaked again on December 14, with 12 trusts responsible for 15 hospitals declaring themselves full.   Overall across the month of December, hospitals in England were 91.9 per cent full. A tenth of hospital trusts had an average bed occupancy rate for the month of 98 per cent or higher.   Dr Hassan said: \u2018These figures are unsurprising. We have not invested in social care, we have not invested in acute hospital beds and in the meantime demand has risen significantly. We need to get patients back into the community and create more hospital beds and more hospital staff.\u2019   The latest figures come after our analysis indicating a link between overcrowding and unexpected deaths.    NHS experts have reported that over the financial year ending March 2016, 16 trusts had death rates that were significantly higher than expected, and 16 had rates that were significantly lower than expected.    The Mail on Sunday discovered that the 16 with significantly higher rates had average bed occupancy of 91.2 per cent over the year.    By contrast, the 16 trusts with lower than expected death rates had 86.3 per cent occupancy. Intriguingly, no trust with an average occupancy below 85 per cent had higher than expected mortality.   Some extremely busy hospitals did manage to achieve lower than expected death rates \u2013 most notably those in London, which are popular with medics.   Experts believe these hospitals managed to compensate for their exceptional workloads by employing more doctors. But the trend, especially outside London, is that fuller hospitals tend to be less safe.   Dr Hassan said: \u2018These findings by The Mail on Sunday raise a red flag that if a hospital is under intense pressure \u2013 as signified by high occupancy rates \u2013 patient care can end up being compromised.\u2019   MP Dr Wollaston, a trained GP, urged the Prime Minister to find the money for a rapid injection of cash to pay for more social care beds \u2018to free up hospitals\u2019.   Last night, NHS England played down the link between overcrowding and higher mortality rates.    A spokeswoman said: \u2018There are multiple inter-related factors which influence these figures for any one hospital, as against a single cause such as bed occupancy rate. It would be medically and scientifically invalid to claim otherwise.\u2019    Casualty code red: Persistent state of emergency at a hospital starring in a new TV series where lack of beds is driving staff to breaking point    It is a TV shocker that dramatically captures the crisis that is gripping Britain\u2019s Health Service.    A leading London hospital is on red alert \u2013 so short of beds that it might have to put sick patients in the gym.   \u2018If we have a significant flu epidemic we are going to be completely stuffed,\u2019 warns Tim Orchard, medical director at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in West London.   \u2018We\u2019ve never started winter with so little spare capacity,\u2019 he bluntly tells fellow executives. \u2018We need to think about\u2026 what we do when we actually run out of beds.\u2019   It may sound like a scene from Casualty but this is real life \u2013 dramatic footage from a worrying fly-on-the-wall documentary about the crisis in NHS hospitals.   It shows, in disturbing detail, stressed senior staff struggling on the brink of Code Red, the dreaded moment for a hospital when there is barely a bed to be found, no matter how great the emergency.    Shot in late autumn, the six-part series called Hospital details the difficult decisions doctors, nurses and managers across the country are now having to make on a daily basis to squeeze as many patients as they can into the finite number of beds they have available.   In the BBC2 series, which starts on Wednesday, doctors are seen arguing among themselves to try to secure a slot for their patient, in a process one surgeon compares to a \u2018moving jigsaw\u2019.   In the first episode, a patient called Simon is seen waiting for an operation to remove a cancerous tumour from his oesophagus.    His surgery has been cancelled before and he is getting close to the end of the eight-week \u2018window\u2019 after chemo and radiotherapy when the complex operation is best undertaken.   But then doctors receive a call telling them that an elderly woman is being brought in from Norfolk \u2013 her aorta, the body\u2019s largest artery, has started to rupture.    Retired primary school teacher Janice Medcalfe will need the intensive care bed if she survives the journey and the operation.   \u2018There\u2019s a patient coming in who might require the intensive care bed,\u2019 Simon tells the camera, trying to remain calm and matter-of-fact.   \u2018If they die, then the bed is available for me,\u2019 he thinks aloud, obviously conflicted.   Asked how that makes him feel, he replies: \u2018Guilty, actually.\u2019   His surgeon, Professor George Hannah, argues with intensive care director Simon Ashworth that he should be allowed to operate, with Simon taking the last space in the 16-bed unit \u2013 a bed usually kept free in case of sudden emergencies.   \u2018Cancelling a cancer patient three times is a serious incident,\u2019 he says.   \u2018There\u2019s a surgeon, there\u2019s a theatre, there\u2019s three or four nurses [available],\u2019 he argues. \u2018It is a waste!\u2019    But Dr Ashworth insists \u2018there is not enough slack in our capacity\u2019 to let Prof Hannah go ahead, adding: \u2018That\u2019s the practical reality.\u2019   Later, Dr Ashworth tells the film-makers: \u2018We do need more capacity because we are always under pressure.   \u2018And it does feel to me like the elastic is a bit nearer to breaking now than it ever was.\u2019   Simon did get his eight-hour operation the following day, but only after a patient was moved to another hospital altogether to make room for him. He was later told it had cleared his cancer, but he tragically died five weeks later.   In another case, a patient with a huge aneurysm \u2013 which means he might die at any moment \u2013 is placed in a similar position.   Doctors have worked for two months to arrange his complex operation, which requires five surgeons, three anaesthetists and other specialists to co-ordinate their diaries.    Software engineer Peter Lai is preparing to be put under by an anaesthetist when he is abruptly told by his surgeon: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry. There\u2019s no bed.\u2019   A shocked Mr Lai responds: \u2018It\u2019s unreal isn\u2019t it? At the last minute \u2013 \u201cYes\u201d and then \u201cNo\u201d.\u2019   Mr Lai, described by staff as an \u2018exceptional human being\u2019 for his calmness and politeness, had his surgery delayed by a month.   When it did take place, it went well, but he died of complications related to surgery six weeks later.   The hospital makes no claims that delays to these patients contributed in any way to their deaths, as there is nothing from their medical cases to suggest that was the case.   But the documentary makes it plain to see how the struggle of dealing with exceptional demand exerts a human price on the psyche of patients, loved ones and staff.   Consultant surgeon George Reese, who manages to get his bowel cancer patient into surgery, says afterwards: \u2018Why should I feel victorious because I was actually allowed to do what I started doing at eight o\u2019clock this morning?   \u2018It\u2019s because the beds are so bad at the moment that it seems rare to be allowed to actually go ahead and do an operation.\u2019   From nurse to surgeon to medical director, all at the hospital lament the lack of available beds.   Site manager Lesley Powls, who has the power to stop pre-planned operations if there are no beds available, admits: \u2018A lot of the time at St Mary\u2019s we are running at 98, 99 per cent capacity, which is extraordinary.   \u2018What that means is that we are always running with one or two empty beds, which isn\u2019t nearly enough.   \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if we never admitted more than one patient a day. But we do.\u2019   \u2018It\u2019s all about beds, beds and more beds,\u2019 says nurse Alice Mackay, who has to find patients to discharge. \u2018The walls are not elastic.\u2019   A meeting is called to sort out the problem, with hospital bosses knowing the situation will not let up until March or April \u2013 and could get worse.   There, gastroenterologist Professor Orchard makes his bald assessment of the situation, admitting that Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs five hospitals including St Mary\u2019s, could run out of beds altogether for the first time in its history.   Lesley Powls admits: \u2018If we get noro[virus], and we lose a ward, organisationally we are not going to be able to manage at the moment. We\u2019ve got nowhere to go.\u2019   Prof Orchard discusses using hospital gyms, the endoscopy unit and cardiac wards to put in extra beds. \u2018It\u2019s about using every square inch of space, even if it doesn\u2019t normally have a bed in it,\u2019 he says.",

The Attorney General's Office said Saturday the official was wounded in the attack Friday in Guadalajara. Surveillance video of the attack shows the gunman following the official in a parking garage.    The official, whose name was not released, was dressed in shorts. The shooting appeared to be a direct attempt to kill the consular employee.   The attacker doesn't appear to try to approach the official while he is walking, but instead waits for him to exit the parking garage in his vehicle and fires a round into the car's windshield.   The consulate said on its Facebook page that the FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information on the attacker. US consular employees and other US agents have been attacked in Mexico in the past; the attackers have usually argued the attacks were cases of mistaken identity.   In 2014, a Mexican gang leader was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2010 slayings in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, of a US consulate employee, her husband and the husband of another employee.   Prosecutors said Arturo Gallegos Castrellon was in charge of a team of assassins with the Barrio Azteca, a gang allied with the Juarez drug cartel, and had ordered the three slayings.   The murders of US consulate employee Leslie Ann Enriquez Catton, her husband, Arthur Redfels, and Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, as they left a children's birthday party were a mistake, former gang members testified during the trial.   Redfels was driving a white SUV that was very similar to a vehicle that Gallegos Castrellon had marked as a target for his team of assassins because they thought it belonged to members of the rival Sinaloa cartel. In 2012, uniformed police pumped 152 bullets into a US Embassy vehicle carrying two CIA officers and a Mexican Navy captain.    The police officers, who wounded the Americans and face attempted murder charges, initially said the people they attacked were in uniform and marked cars, and that they had responded to fire from the SUV.    But details of the attorney general's investigation said those attacked were in street clothes, riding in unmarked vehicles (including two of their personal cars) and under order at all times from their commanding officers.   A Mexican drug cartel lieutenant pleaded guilty in 2013 to murder and attempted murder of an officer or employee of the United States in the Feb. 15, 2011, shootings of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.   The attackers acknowledged they were members of a Los Zetas Cartel hit squad and directly participated in the attack, which resulted in the death of ICE agent Jaime Zapata and the wounding of his colleague Victor Avila, both based in Texas.   According to court documents, a commander in Los Zetas Cartel tried to hijack the agents' armored government vehicle as it was driving on Highway 57 in San Luis Potosi.    After hit squads forced the vehicle off the road and surrounded it, the Zetas commander ordered the US agents to get out.    The agents refused and tried to identify themselves in Spanish as diplomats from the American embassy, but the hit squad members fired into the vehicle, striking both of them.",

   "7. content": "Once again winter has brought a predicted and predictable crisis in the NHS. There are alarming stories of patients lying for many hours on trolleys, and even dying on them. Some hospitals have simply run out of space to put the sick and injured.   In the weeks running up to Christmas some hospitals were close to turning away critically ill patients because they were running at 100 per cent capacity.   One did not have a single general or acute-care ward bed free for 27 days. Another was full for 23 days.   The effects cannot be hidden, and they are distressing for patients and their relatives and also for medical staff. Corridors and equipment rooms serve as temporary wards. Nurses are in tears because they cannot do their jobs properly in the conditions in which they find themselves.   Everyone knew this was coming. Yet it was not prevented. And it is not acceptable in a First-World health service, that such things could happen. Of course millions of us know the other side, the dedicated doctors, nurses and ancillaries, the brilliant work ceaselessly done to save lives and cure diseases.   But why should this have to be such a struggle? The British Red Cross speaks of a \u2018humanitarian crisis\u2019, and others of \u2018meltdown\u2019. This may seem exaggerated when we think of true crises such as that in Syria, where hospitals are heaps of rubble, there are no drugs and a trolley in a corridor would be a mercy.   But it is the comparative position which is the scandal. A country as rich as ours should not be in this position. Our Continental equivalents are not in the same mess.   Where to look? Spending sprees and reorganisation have not solved underlying difficulties. Centralising Accident and Emergency (as The Mail on Sunday warned) has made matters worse. Perhaps the single most soluble problem is bed-blocking caused by the serious breakdown of social care which compels hospitals to surrender so much of their space to the elderly, who should really be elsewhere.   This at least is something the Prime Minister can readily tackle, not least by abandoning David Cameron\u2019s absurd and futile target of spending 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income on foreign aid (much of which is wasted or worse) and diverting the funds to strengthen and expand social care. She could do that today.   Cogito ergo... dumb    Did the great philosophers of the distant past, such as Aristotle, or the mighty minds who revolutionised European thought a few centuries ago, such as Spinoza, Descartes or Kant, serve the cause of \u2018colonialism\u2019?   Of course not. These great teachers were concerned with questions which soar high above all this, questions of how we think, why we and the universe exist at all, how we know what we know.   How horrified they would be to hear suggestions that they should be dropped from the curriculum of a major London university, sidelined, or \u2018taught from a critical standpoint\u2019 because of the colour of their skin. Any college that listened to such pleas would cease to be a university in the true sense, and become no more than a mouthpiece of propaganda.   Those who do not value education themselves might seem pitiable, but when they try to deny learning to others, they are dangerous and must be opposed.   Our universities are in danger from student censors, and need to fight hard to save themselves before political commissars ruin them completely.",

People could remember a package that was delivered to France, they can remember who asked for it, they can remember the route it took, who delivered it, the times it arrived.

It is very disappointing.\u2019   When asked about Brailsford\u2019s Fluimucil explanation, Kenworthy said: \u2018Well that\u2019s what Dave Brailsford came out with at the hearing. But actually, if you recall, he didn\u2019t say, \u201cI know that\u2019s what it was.\u201d He said, \u201cI have been told that\u2019s what it was.\u201d \u2019   Committee chairman Damian Collins MP said there was \u2018no paper trail\u2019 to back up the claim of Team Sky\u2019s doctor Richard Freeman that the package contained Fluimucil.   Mr Collins added: \u2018The whole story doesn\u2019t look good and\u2026 has changed when it\u2019s been challenged at various times and therefore that undermines any confidence we might have.   \u2018The one man who should know is Dr Freeman.\u2019   Mr Collins urged Dr Freeman to make the medical records available to UKAD if they exist.",

The terrorist \u2013 who has dubbed himself Abu Mugheera Al-Britani, meaning \u2018from Britain\u2019 \u2013 has written in detail about his experience in the notorious US prison camp.   Although Al-Britani\u2019s real identity has not been established, at least 16 UK nationals and residents were held at the military camp in Cuba.   His account will fuel concerns that some freed terror suspects have not abandoned their fanatical ideology and could remain a threat to the public. It will also raise fears that compensation paid to former inmates is helping to fund terror campaigns.   All the UK-related Guantanamo inmates have now been released and, between them, have received a total of \u00a320 million in High Court compensation paid for by the British taxpayer.    The money was handed over after detainees sued MI5 and MI6 for complicity in their alleged torture at the hands of the Americans.   Al-Britani claims he \u2018spent years\u2019 at Guantanamo Bay, where more than 700 of the world\u2019s most dangerous Islamic terrorists were imprisoned in the aftermath of 9/11.   In an online magazine for fanatics, he writes: \u2018Sitting in the blessed land of al-Shaam [Greater Syria], reflecting on those weeks and days spent behind bars, I thank Allah for releasing me and providing me with the opportunity of carrying out jihad in his path again.\u2019   Al-Britani is the second British ex-Guantanamo detainee known to have fled to Syria to join jihadi groups. In October, it was reported that Muslim convert Jamal al-Harith, from Manchester, had fled to Syria to join Islamic State (IS).    At the time, he was reportedly fighting near Aleppo.   Al-Harith was released from Guantanamo in 2004 after being detained for two years. He was arrested in Kandahar by US troops in February 2002.    Al-Harith received around \u00a31 million in compensation from the Government, which he is feared to have spent to flee to Syria \u2013 as well as fund jihad.   Al-Britani, who claims to be in his 30s, says he was in Afghanistan when the US-led coalition invaded the country in 2001.   He claims that he was based in the Tora Bora mountains when US troops arrived hunting for then Al Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden. Al-Britani and ten others were ordered to cross into Pakistan, where locals would help them travel to Lahore.   When the militants arrived, they were met by Pakistani soldiers, who told them they would escort them. But the next day, the troops drove the jihadis to a military camp and imprisoned them, later handing them to the Americans.   The Foreign Office said last night it could not ascertain who Abu Mugheera was.",

   "7. content": "It is a TV shocker that dramatically captures the crisis that is gripping Britain\u2019s Health Service.    A leading London hospital is on red alert \u2013 so short of beds that it might have to put sick patients in the gym.   \u2018If we have a significant flu epidemic we are going to be completely stuffed,\u2019 warns Tim Orchard, medical director at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in West London.   \u2018We\u2019ve never started winter with so little spare capacity,\u2019 he bluntly tells fellow executives. \u2018We need to think about\u2026 what we do when we actually run out of beds.\u2019   It may sound like a scene from Casualty but this is real life \u2013 dramatic footage from a worrying fly-on-the-wall documentary about the crisis in NHS hospitals.   It shows, in disturbing detail, stressed senior staff struggling on the brink of Code Red, the dreaded moment for a hospital when there is barely a bed to be found, no matter how great the emergency.    Shot in late autumn, the six-part series called Hospital details the difficult decisions doctors, nurses and managers across the country are now having to make on a daily basis to squeeze as many patients as they can into the finite number of beds they have available.   In the BBC2 series, which starts on Wednesday, doctors are seen arguing among themselves to try to secure a slot for their patient, in a process one surgeon compares to a \u2018moving jigsaw\u2019.   In the first episode, a patient called Simon is seen waiting for an operation to remove a cancerous tumour from his oesophagus.    His surgery has been cancelled before and he is getting close to the end of the eight-week \u2018window\u2019 after chemo and radiotherapy when the complex operation is best undertaken.   But then doctors receive a call telling them that an elderly woman is being brought in from Norfolk \u2013 her aorta, the body\u2019s largest artery, has started to rupture.    Retired primary school teacher Janice Medcalfe will need the intensive care bed if she survives the journey and the operation.   \u2018There\u2019s a patient coming in who might require the intensive care bed,\u2019 Simon tells the camera, trying to remain calm and matter-of-fact.   \u2018If they die, then the bed is available for me,\u2019 he thinks aloud, obviously conflicted.   Asked how that makes him feel, he replies: \u2018Guilty, actually.\u2019   His surgeon, Professor George Hannah, argues with intensive care director Simon Ashworth that he should be allowed to operate, with Simon taking the last space in the 16-bed unit \u2013 a bed usually kept free in case of sudden emergencies.   Hospitals should have no more than 85 per cent of beds occupied at any time.    But in December, the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, did not have a single spare bed for 27 out of 31 nights, making it the fullest hospital in England.   The 383-bed facility was full for nine days at the start of the month, then there was a two day lull when five beds briefly became available, followed by another 12-day stretch at full capacity until Christmas.   With patients discharged on Christmas Eve, and no pre-planned operations carried out over the break, occupancy dropped briefly.    But the hospital was full again from Boxing Day to New Year\u2019s Eve.   \u2018Cancelling a cancer patient three times is a serious incident,\u2019 he says.   \u2018There\u2019s a surgeon, there\u2019s a theatre, there\u2019s three or four nurses [available],\u2019 he argues. \u2018It is a waste!\u2019    But Dr Ashworth insists \u2018there is not enough slack in our capacity\u2019 to let Prof Hannah go ahead, adding: \u2018That\u2019s the practical reality.\u2019   Later, Dr Ashworth tells the film-makers: \u2018We do need more capacity because we are always under pressure.   \u2018And it does feel to me like the elastic is a bit nearer to breaking now than it ever was.\u2019   Simon did get his eight-hour operation the following day, but only after a patient was moved to another hospital altogether to make room for him. He was later told it had cleared his cancer, but he tragically died five weeks later.   In another case, a patient with a huge aneurysm \u2013 which means he might die at any moment \u2013 is placed in a similar position.   Doctors have worked for two months to arrange his complex operation, which requires five surgeons, three anaesthetists and other specialists to co-ordinate their diaries.    Software engineer Peter Lai is preparing to be put under by an anaesthetist when he is abruptly told by his surgeon: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry. There\u2019s no bed.\u2019   A shocked Mr Lai responds: \u2018It\u2019s unreal isn\u2019t it? At the last minute \u2013 \u201cYes\u201d and then \u201cNo\u201d.\u2019   Mr Lai, described by staff as an \u2018exceptional human being\u2019 for his calmness and politeness, had his surgery delayed by a month.   When it did take place, it went well, but he died of complications related to surgery six weeks later.   The hospital makes no claims that delays to these patients contributed in any way to their deaths, as there is nothing from their medical cases to suggest that was the case.   But the documentary makes it plain to see how the struggle of dealing with exceptional demand exerts a human price on the psyche of patients, loved ones and staff.   Consultant surgeon George Reese, who manages to get his bowel cancer patient into surgery, says afterwards: \u2018Why should I feel victorious because I was actually allowed to do what I started doing at eight o\u2019clock this morning?   \u2018It\u2019s because the beds are so bad at the moment that it seems rare to be allowed to actually go ahead and do an operation.\u2019   From nurse to surgeon to medical director, all at the hospital lament the lack of available beds.   Site manager Lesley Powls, who has the power to stop pre-planned operations if there are no beds available, admits: \u2018A lot of the time at St Mary\u2019s we are running at 98, 99 per cent capacity, which is extraordinary.   \u2018What that means is that we are always running with one or two empty beds, which isn\u2019t nearly enough.   \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if we never admitted more than one patient a day. But we do.\u2019   \u2018It\u2019s all about beds, beds and more beds,\u2019 says nurse Alice Mackay, who has to find patients to discharge. \u2018The walls are not elastic.\u2019   A meeting is called to sort out the problem, with hospital bosses knowing the situation will not let up until March or April \u2013 and could get worse.   There, gastroenterologist Professor Orchard makes his bald assessment of the situation, admitting that Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs five hospitals including St Mary\u2019s, could run out of beds altogether for the first time in its history.   Lesley Powls admits: \u2018If we get noro[virus], and we lose a ward, organisationally we are not going to be able to manage at the moment. We\u2019ve got nowhere to go.\u2019   Prof Orchard discusses using hospital gyms, the endoscopy unit and cardiac wards to put in extra beds. \u2018It\u2019s about using every square inch of space, even if it doesn\u2019t normally have a bed in it,\u2019 he says.",

Shane Olivea, 35, told  The Columbus Dispatch  he was high every day following his rookie year with the San Diego Chargers.   'At my height on Vicodin, I would take 125 a day,' he said. 'It got to the point I would take a pile of 15 Vicodin and would have to take them with chocolate milk. If I did it with water or Gatorade, I'd throw it up.'   Olivea said he obtained the pills from his own sources, including one in Mexico. He would park at an Arby's restaurant near the border and pay a cab driver he knew $100 to go to a Tijuana 'pharmacy.'   'You could buy anything you want if you had cash,' Olivea said. 'I'd go buy a couple hundred Vicodin, or by then I'd progressed to Oxycontin.'   Olivea said he spent nearly $584,000 on painkillers. He began to withdraw from teammates and his relationship with coaches and management suffered. He was benched late in the 2007 season and his weight rose to nearly 390 pounds.   Olivea's parents worried after he became reluctant to respond to them, too. His mother organized an intervention, with his mother, brother, and Chargers teammate Roman Oben all asking him to seek treatment.    Knowing he was at the end of line and needed help or he would die, Olivea checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California. He said doctors there told him he was lucky to be alive. In fact, he said doctors made him take blood tests twice because they couldn't believe what they were seeing.   'They both looked at me and said, 'We've never seen anybody living with that amount of opioids in you. You're literally a walking miracle,'' Olivea said. 'That was a punch to the gut.'   Olivea said that the problem began after his rookie season, his first full year with the NFL, which saw him play 21 games. He was so sore and exhausted at the end, he said he slept for a week straight.   Then one night, he took a Vicodin from a teammate. He said he was hooked almost instantly.    He eventually progressed to Oxycontin, and played while on it. 'How I functioned and played is head-scratching,' he said.   After being released by the Chargers, Olivea signed with the New York Giants while in rehab. He was released again after hurting his back.   He spent a few years training for a comeback that never happened - general managers didn't want him anymore.   'I literally got bigger, faster, quicker than I\u2019d ever been,' Olivea told the outlet. 'I was like, \u2018Ain\u2019t this a bitch? I\u2019m finally clean and now I can\u2019t get a shot.'   Olivea re-enrolled in Ohio State in 2015, and graduated in December with a degree in sport industry.   A big part of the reason he went back to school is his mother, who told him he'd bought her enough gifts - the one thing she really wanted was for her son to get his college degree.     He said he has a couple of job leads. And though he hasn't coached before, he said his playing experience makes him think he'd do well on and off the field, including helping others thinking of turning to pain pills.   'If you got it, you can spot it,' Olivea said. 'I can spot an addict in a public setting. I know the behavior. I know the tendencies. I know what he's going to do. I'll be able to notice somebody going down that slippery path and maybe catch them.'",

   "7. content": "Spacewalking astronauts hooked up fancy new batteries Friday on the International Space Station's sprawling power grid.   NASA reported that all three lithium-ion batteries were up and running, a successful start to the space agency's long-term effort to upgrade the aging solar power system.   Before venturing out, Commander Shane Kimbrough and Peggy Whitson got a hand from a robot that took care of most of the grunt work \u2014 Dextre, a hulking machine with 11-foot arms.   Remotely operating Dextre outside the 250-mile-high lab, flight controllers in Houston spent the past week replacing decade-old, nickel-hydrogen batteries with the new ones.    Handling all those batteries \u2014 each about half a refrigerator in size \u2014 was cumbersome and time-consuming.   On Friday, it was up to Kimbrough and Whitson to wire up three of the six new batteries delivered last month in a Japanese cargo capsule.    The two made fairly quick work of it.   'I'm on a roll, right?' Kimbrough asked Whitson halfway through the job.    The two were so far ahead that they tackled some extra work.   The most sophisticated space robot ever built, Dextre is a space handyman with a mission: keep the International Space Station (ISS) ship-shape.    Dextre's role is to perform maintenance work and repairs like changing batteries and replacing cameras outside the ISS.    Dextre has two arms measuring 3.35 metres in length (almost as long as the robot is tall).    Each arm has seven joints that are able to move up and down, side to side, and are also able to rotate, or roll.    This gives the space handyman a much wider range of motion than the human arm.    Your wrist can move in three directions, as can your shoulder, but your elbow can only move in one direction, whereas Dextre can bend backwards at the elbow to touch the back of its arm.    Dextre's hands are actually grippers that work much like a Swiss Army knife: each hand has a retractable motorized socket wrench to turn bolts and connect or detach hardware; a camera and lights for close-up viewing; and a retractable umbilical connector (like a plug-in) to provide electricity, data and video connections when the robot handles sensitive electronic equipment and to support experimental scientific experiments.      'I look forward to doing it again,' Kimbrough told Mission Control as the 6 \u00bd-hour spacewalk drew to a close.   Kimbrough and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet will plug in three more batteries next Friday.    NASA expects it will take two to three years to change out all 48 nickel-hydrogen batteries that make up the station's solar power system.    The lithium-ion batteries are so efficient that only 24 will be needed, saving space for other items during supply runs.   The batteries store power that is tapped whenever the orbiting outpost is on the nighttime side of Earth.   Dextre, the station's robotic handyman, removed the old batteries and popped in the new ones in a series of maneuvers that began on New Year's Eve.    The robot also loosened bolts on metal attachment plates for the new batteries, saving the spacewalkers even more time.   Starting Sunday, Dextre will be back at it, paving the way for next Friday's spacewalk.   NASA's chief astronaut, Christopher Cassidy, said from Mission Control that sticky bolts often stymie astronauts, so everyone was grateful to turn over the chores to Dextre, short for dexterous.   Spacewalks are high-risk activities, NASA managers noted, and so reducing crew time outside is always preferable.    Almost as a reminder, Mission Control's main contact for the spacewalkers was Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who nearly drowned in 2013 when his helmet flooded with water from his spacesuit's cooling system.    He directed Kimbrough and Whitson's every move, and praised them for 'an awesome job.'   Most of the old batteries will be junked along with other station trash in a month, burning up in the atmosphere along with the Japanese supply ship that delivered the new batteries.   Whitson now ties the record for most spacewalks by a woman \u2014 seven. At 56, she's the world's oldest and most experienced spacewoman.",

One tweeter cut Alyssa out of the picture and placed her in front of a tidy room with the caption 'fixed'.   Zooming in on a box of snacks on the floor, Tim Anderson wrote: 'And after dinner, she'll be eating floor marshmellows for dessert.'    Tweeter Lechusa sarcastically quipped: 'But ok, can you find Waldo?'   A poster called Nick was similarly unimpressed and tweeted: 'How can you take a mirror pic like that knowing your room looks the way it does.'      Another poster called Nane said: 'There's literally a rat in her room.'   The claim caused others to hunt for the rodent, before one tweeter zoomed in on a fuzzy looking grey shape in the background of the photo and alerted others to his discovery.    However, Alyssa has been unmoved by her critics and has made fun of the furore - even using it to shine a spotlight on a new set of selfies.   She tweeted: 'My brother is going to be so impressed when I tell him I'm a meme. He's never going to clear his room again.'   As she received thousands of tweets from followers, she posted: 'What an optimal moment to post these beautiful pictures of me.'",

The head of the Civil Aviation Regulatory Authority told Lusa that it's too early to say what caused the damage to the plane.   A statement from the Drone Manufacturers Alliance,  USA Today  reports, said it had not been confirmed that the object was a drone, but said: 'Nevertheless, we take these reports seriously, and our member companies stand ready to offer assistance to Mozambique\u2019s aviation authorities as they investigate this incident.'

The Law Commission, an independent body that recommends changes to legislation, is also considering new recommendations on sweeping reform to Britain\u2019s strict law on surrogacy.   It says the current rules need to be reviewed because they have \u2018struggled to adapt to changes in attitudes, a growing demand for surrogacy arrangements, and an increasing number of overseas surrogacy arrangements\u2019.   Cabinet Office Minister Baroness Chisholm of Owlpen told peers last month that the radical changes were needed because legislation dating back to the 1980s was struggling \u2018to keep pace with 21st Century attitudes and lifestyles and that \u2018family structures are now much more diverse\u2019.   But last night family campaigners said that research shows children do much better growing up with two parents \u2013 and that any liberalisation of surrogacy laws risks treating babies as commodities.   Robert Flello MP, vice-chairman of the All Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, said: \u2018This is about the human rights of the child.   \u2018The right for the child to have two parents is being deliberately overlooked. A child has the right to be brought up in a loving family by its mother and father and that should be the starting point for Government and society.\u2019   Former High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge, founder of think-tank The Marriage Foundation, said the planned change was yet another erosion \u2018of the traditional model of the two-parent family\u2019.   He said: \u2018I have no doubt at all that this change further undermines the well established principle that children do best when they are brought up in a stable home by both their biological parents.\u2019   Until now only couples have been able to become the legal parents of a child born to a surrogate mother. But last year, as revealed by this newspaper, a High Court judge ruled that the couples\u2019 restriction breaches the human rights of single people. The landmark case was brought by a British man who wanted to obtain a Parental Order after paying \u00a330,000 to an American woman to give birth to his child.   Now the Government has revealed that it is to amend the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 to remove this restriction because it is incompatible with the Human Rights Act.   In future any single person will be able to apply for a Parental Order and so become the parent of a surrogate child. The change is being made through a \u2018remedial order\u2019, which the Government can use to amend laws at odds with the European Convention on Human Rights without requiring a vote. Dr Trevor Stammers, of the Family Education Trust which campaigns for family values, condemned the move as \u2018an assault on the child and traditional family life\u2019.   NOW: Only couples are allowed to obtain the legal ruling needed to bring up a baby born to a surrogate.   After the baby is born, the surrogate mother will be named on its birth certificate.   So the intended parents must go to the High Court to obtain a Parental Order that gives them the legal right to parenthood.   But the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 states that only \u2018two people\u2019 in a marriage, civil partnership or long-term relationship can do so, even though single people can adopt.    FUTURE: A High Court judge ruled last year that the couples rule breaches human rights law, after a challenge brought by a single British man who had a baby through a surrogate and wanted to obtain a Parental Order.   The Government agreed that the restriction went against Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion or any other status \u2013 including being single \u2013 as well as Article 8, guaranteeing the right to a family life.As a result, Ministers are drafting a \u2018remedial order\u2019 to the 2008, removing the references to couples.   He said: \u2018Bringing up a child is an extremely difficult task and two parents are better than one.\u2019   Surrogacy laws were introduced in the UK in 1985 after Kim Cotton became Britain\u2019s first surrogate mother by being paid to carry a baby for an infertile Swedish couple.In response to her case Parliament banned women from advertising themselves as surrogates or receiving payment other than \u2018reasonable expenses\u2019.   There are now three not-for-profit agencies that match childless couples with willing surrogates.   As a result of the restrictions on payment there is a shortage of surrogate mothers in the UK, leading many people wanting a surrogate baby to travel to countries where commercial arrangements are legal.   The Law Commission will look at claims that the conditions on Parental Orders, needed to transfer legal parenthood from the birth mother to the intended parents, are \u2018unnecessarily restrictive\u2019.   The Department of Health will also produce on an \u2018authoritative\u2019 guide to clarify the rules around surrogacy and emphasise the benefits of undertaking surrogacy in UK clinics rather than going abroad.",

The head of SOAS\u2019s Religions and Philosophies department Dr Erica Hunter said the union\u2019s viewpoint was \u2018rather ridiculous\u2019, adding: \u2018I would firmly resist dropping philosophers or historians just because it was fashionable.\u2019   Mr Habib declined to comment.",

Once again Lamiya Haji Bashar had tried to escape her tormentors. And once again, the Yazidi teenager had been caught.   A judge in Mosul\u2019s sharia court stared at her. After being told Lamiya kept trying to escape \u2013 this time she had been caught leading a breakout of several other girls seized by the terror group \u2013 he made his ruling.    \u2018He said that either they must kill me or cut off my foot to stop me escaping,\u2019 Lamiya recalls.   So how did she respond to such a terrifying sentence?    \u2018I told him that if you cut off one foot then I will escape with the other. I told the judge I would never give up. So they replied they would keep on torturing me if I tried to escape.\u2019   She showed immense bravery, yet it was typical of this remarkable teenager. Eventually her life \u2013 and her feet \u2013 were saved by a senior IS official, who argued that she should be sold to a new \u2018owner\u2019.   Lamiya was one of the several thousand Yazidi women and girls condemned to sex slavery, traded like animals and abused by barbarous fanatics. Another year of fear, agony and assaults lay ahead of her, held captive by a cruel surgeon, who traded kidnapped women and children when not stitching up wounded jihadis.   But now Lamiya is free, though even her escape was etched in pain and tragedy. She was injured in an explosion that left extensive physical scars on her face to go with the deep psychological scars on her mind.   I met Lamiya in a quiet hotel in Germany, where this extraordinary, softly spoken young woman told me her story \u2013 a tale of savagery far beyond anyone\u2019s worst nightmare.   She heard her father and brothers being shot, was enslaved by their cruel killers, and then beaten and raped for almost two years by a succession of older men.   During her time trapped in the IS heartland of Syria and northern Iraq, Lamiya saw children sold to old men as sex slaves, and she was forced to help make suicide bombs. At one point Lamiya was thrown into a room to be gang-raped by 40 fanatics. Yet she never buckled. \u2018These men were more than monsters,\u2019 she says. \u2018That\u2019s why I stayed strong, because I wanted to challenge the life they gave me.\u2019   Now, showing remarkable courage, she has taken the unusual step for her gender, her religion and her region, in speaking openly about the horrors.   It is hard to believe that she is still only 18. Lamiya\u2019s stance was recognised last month with the EU\u2019s top human rights award \u2013 the Sakharov Prize. Nadia Murad, another Yazidi sex slave survivor, was also honoured.   Their stories remind the world that so many more Yazidi women and girls remain caught in similarly appalling circumstances by bigots who view them as infidels due to their ancient beliefs.   The 400,000-strong Yazidi community is persecuted by extreme Muslims for devil-worship since their religion, blending aspects of ancient Middle East traditions, reveres an angel which takes the form of a blue peacock. I first broke news about their plight in 2014.   Lamiya comes from the Yazidi village of Kocho in northern Iraq, where the 1,800 residents were told by IS to convert to Islam or die. Until then she had had a happy childhood, growing up on a prosperous farm owned by a wealthy family. She went to school, worked hard and hoped to become a teacher.   \u2018When I first heard of Daesh [another term for IS] on television I thought it was some kind of new animal,\u2019 she says, underlining her youth. \u2018I didn\u2019t know they were a terror gang.\u2019   When IS swept into Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city, 80 miles west of Kocho, elders realised their village might become caught up in the spiralling conflict, but they never thought peaceful civilians like them would be targeted.    However, in early August 2014, after capturing the nearby city of Sinjar, two cars filled with IS fighters arrived.    \u2018They asked us to convert, but said they would do no harm,\u2019 Lamiya says. The village was surrounded, yet a few families managed to flee.   Then, on August 15, a large force of black-clad men stormed the village \u2013 locals recognised some as those from nearby towns.   Everyone was ordered into the school, stripped of all their possessions, and females were taken to the first floor.   \u2018I was so scared. I was thinking of my father, my family, my life,\u2019 says Lamiya. \u2018Then they took all our men \u2013 fathers, sons, brothers.\u2019   It was the last time she saw her father and two brothers. IS told the terrified women that the men were being sent to Mount Sinjar, where many Yazidi had sought refuge. \u2018Ten minutes later we heard the shooting start,\u2019 recalls Lamiya.   The men were slaughtered in their own streets. Then the women were split up: married women and younger children were taken to nearby Tal Afar, while unmarried women and teenagers were sent to Mosul. Older women were shot dead the next day.   Lamiya and three of her sisters soon got a taste of the fate that lay ahead. \u2018The men began attacking us, touching us and kissing us.\u2019   In Mosul, the captives were forced into a big building filled with hundreds of similar-aged Yazidi. It turned out to be a market for militants to buy sex slaves. \u2018Men came all the time to choose girls. If someone refused to go, they were beaten with cables,\u2019 says Lamiya. \u2018It was so painful to see these old men, these monsters, attack the girls. Even girls of nine and ten were crying and begging not to be attacked. I can\u2019t describe how horrible it was.\u2019   A Saudi man in his 40s bought Lamiya and one of her sisters, taking them to the IS stronghold of Raqqa and keeping them handcuffed much of the time. \u2018He was a very bad man,\u2019 she says.   \u2018He beat us for the three days we were with him.   \u2018Once he tried to kill me with his hands around my neck because I rejected his advances.\u2019   To soften up the sisters, the man took the pair to an IS base and threw them into a room. \u2018There were about 40 fighters who abused us. You can\u2019t imagine this \u2013 two small girls at the hands of so many monsters. Terrible things happened to us.\u2019   Afterwards the girls were sold to different fighters, fetching about \u00a3100 each. Lamiya ended up with an even more brutal man from Mosul.   Although kept in a locked room, she made the first of five escape attempts when alone in an apartment by jumping from a window. Spotting a local man, she begged him for help and he took her to hide in his home for three days.   \u2018The family asked if a relative could come and pick me up, but they were all in captivity. The family was afraid of Daesh, so after three days the man called two fighters, saying he had found a girl.\u2019   Her \u2018owner\u2019 was quickly tracked down thanks to a computerised registration system used by IS to record sales of women. Before being handed back, Lamiya was tortured by six men before her furious master beat her viciously.   After her second escape attempt, the man sold her. When I tell Lamiya she was obviously trouble, she smiles shyly for the first time.    \u2018Every time I tried to escape they tortured me, but it made me stronger. I never gave up.   \u2018I saw so many atrocities, so many crimes. This gave me the power to keep fighting against them.\u2019   She was taken by a white-haired man from Mosul, who lived with his wife and son. \u2018I told him you cannot take me into your family as a slave,\u2019 says Lamiya. \u2018Please don\u2019t do things with me there. Then he raped me.   \u2018I once asked his wife and mother to help protect me from the sexual abuse but they said that was his right since I was an infidel.\u2019   This man held her for two months. Later Lamiya discovered he had another wife: a blonde, blue-eyed younger woman who spoke German. \u2018She was very nice but I could not believe she accepted this man.\u2019   After another escape attempt, Lamiya was passed on to an IS emir. \u2018Each man was worse than the one before,\u2019 she admits. \u2018Everyone said I was difficult, so they beat me from the start. They were always beating me, always abusing me.\u2019   The IS leader was an expert bomb-maker, with a big basement in Mosul filled with cars, liquid explosives and electrical equipment. Lamiya was made to work beside men making suicide vests \u2013 she was taught to connect the wiring as they churned out 50 devices each day.   As she worked, she heard air raids and missiles exploding nearby.   \u2018I hoped they would attack us and we would die,\u2019 Lamiya says. \u2018I wanted to end my suffering. I also wanted them to destroy this terrible place because it was making bombs.\u2019    At one point, when some other Yazidi girls were bought down to the basement, Lamiya persuaded them all to make a dash for freedom. This led to another brutal beating and her being hauled before the sharia court.   She was later kept by a surgeon, who made her run errands in his hospital. Eventually he gave her a mobile phone so that he could summon her \u2013 but Lamiya used it to contact an uncle in Kurdistan.   At that point, she was being held close to the Kurdish front line, and her uncle paid a smuggler $7,500 (about \u00a36,100) to get her out.   She walked through the night with Katherine, another teenager from Kocho, and a nine-year-old girl called Almas. But at 4am, Katherine inadvertently stepped on a mine, killing her and the nine-year-old, and leaving Lamiya with her terrible injuries.   Lamiya remembers little after the explosion, which happened nine months ago. Kurdish soldiers carried her to hospital, where doctors were forced to remove one of her eyes. They also treated her wounds before her uncle came for her.    Later she was taken to Germany by Luftbrucke Irak (Air Bridge Iraq), a charity that helps children and terror victims. The charity funded two more operations, restoring some sight to her left eye, and laser treatment to soften her facial scars.   Unsurprisingly, Lamiya remains traumatised and is plagued by nightmares. \u2018I think about the suffering of all those other girls,\u2019 she says.   They include her nine-year-old sister, Mayada, glimpsed only in a snatched photograph standing before a black IS flag. Five other sisters have managed to escaped the clutches of jihadis.   One day Lamiya wants to restart her studies and go to university. But for now, this courageous teenager speaks out to remind the world that 3,600 Yazidi women and girls are still enslaved by IS.   \u2018These people wanted to eliminate my people and my religion but we will survive,\u2019 says Lamiya. \u2018My job is to tell those women and girls that they are not alone. And we will demand justice for those monsters who hurt us so much.\u2019",

The official advice was to stick to a low-fat diet, and it just didn't work. I also don't think my dad took his diabetes seriously. He thought taking pills was enough.   The Whitingtons were able to transform Geoff's life. He was quite far gone by the time they started, even looking at lower-limb amputation. His transformation \u2013 reversing his diabetes and losing six stone \u2013 was on a huge scale but even modest levels of weight loss, 6lb say, can make a difference.   There is a fatalism among medical professionals about weight loss and a widespread belief that diets don't work. I think this is misplaced. Yes, there are terrible diets out there but there are also those with a decent track record. The low-fat diet, which was and still seems to be the mainstay of dietary advice, is not one of them. In long-term trials, it loses out hands down to the 'Mediterranean diet' \u2013 low in sugar, low in refined carbs and high in healthy fats from olive oil, nuts and fish. And it's not just about weight loss and diabetes but other important health measures such as the risk of developing heart disease.   Support is crucial as going it alone is miserable and hard.   Some people who do the Blood Sugar Diet prefer a more gradual 5:2 approach and don't do 800 calories all the time, others just switch to a Mediterranean diet and that helps. The important thing is to cut out rapidly digestible refined carbs \u2013 those that quickly translate into sugar in the gut, such as white bread and white rice \u2013 and, of course, sugar itself. Improving blood sugar levels is not just about losing weight and improving diabetes, but a whole host of other health issues.",

Volkswagen will notify owners, and repairs will be made free of charge.   The automaker traced the problem to the use of an incorrect solder compound, which may cause cracks that prevent sufficient electrical power to flow.   This is the latest recall to hit the embattled company, which has been embroiled in an emissions scandal in which Volkswagen admitted circumventing the emissions control systems in about 550,000 vehicles sold in the United States since 2008 with the 2.0-liter diesel engine.    As many as 11 million vehicles worldwide may be affected, according  Consumer Reports . This resulted in a $14.7billion settlement.   Additionally, in mid-December, 83,000 3-liter diesel vehicles with model years between 2009 and 2016, were recalled.    Previously, the company agreed to buy back 475,000 2-liter diesel cars, according to  CNBC .   On Friday, a South Korean court sentenced an executive of Volkswagen's local unit to one year and six months in prison for fabricating documents on emissions and noise-level tests to achieve certification for vehicles for import.   This is the latest fallout from Volkswagen's emissions-test cheating scandal that last year resulted in a sales suspension in South Korea, a once fast-growing market for the German automaker.   'Volkswagen has by itself undermined its credibility as a global brand as a result of this crime which has caused grave social and economic damages ...,' the Seoul Central District Court said in a statement, referring to the suspension.   The court statement only gave the surname of the executive, Yun, and said he was convicted of document fabrication, obstruction of work and the violation of an environment law.   In August, South Korea's environment ministry suspended the sales of 80 models of Volkswagen, Audi and Bentley vehicles, and fined the group's local unit 17.8 billion won ($14.91 million)for allegedly forging documents on emissions or noise-level tests.   South Korea has taken a particularly hard line against the automaker, filing criminal complaints against executives including Johannes Thammer, managing director of Audi Volkswagen Korea, raiding their offices and fining the company an additional 37.3 billion won ($31.87 million) for false advertising.   \"Audi Volkswagen Korea (AVK) has fully cooperated with the PO (Prosecutor's Office) and will participate in good faith in the upcoming court proceedings,\" the unit said in statement after Yun's conviction.   Seoul prosecutors are still investigating the case.",

'The FBI failed there,' Bryan Santiago told The Associated Press. 'We're not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this.'   'The federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn't do anything,' the brother said in Spanish, speaking outside his family's house in Penuelas, Puerto Rico.   In recent years, Esteban Santiago \u2014 a new dad \u2014 had been living in Anchorage, Alaska. But there were signs of trouble.   Esteban told FBI agents in Alaska that the government was forcing him to watch ISIS videos, a law enforcement official said Friday. The FBI office in Alaska interviewed Esteban Santiago and then notified police, who took him in for a mental health evaluation.   He was also charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend's Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents.   A month later, municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client.   Bryan Santiago said his brother had requested psychological help but barely received any.   'I told him to go to church or to seek professional help,' he said.   Family members have said Esteban Santiago changed after serving a yearlong tour in Iraq. He was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007.   He deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Major Paul Dahlen.   Esteban Santiago's mother wiped tears from her eyes as she stood inside a screen door Saturday. She said her son had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode near two friends while serving in Iraq.   Alaska National Guard spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Candis Olmstead told  The New York Times  that two soldiers in Santiago's company had died during his stint in Iraq.   Former neighbor Ursula Candelario in Penuelas recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. 'He was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,' she said. 'We're in shock. I couldn't believe it.'   Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead told AP. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for 'unsatisfactory performance.'   His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said.   She would not elaborate on his discharge. The Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged.   While it is unclear if Esteban Santiago had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, as many as one in five veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan develop the affliction each year, according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs.   A 2014 Veterans Affairs study found that almost 30 percent of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who sought treatment at VA hospitals were diagnosed with PTSD symptoms.   His uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago. FBI agents arrived at their house to question them on Friday.   Maria Ruiz told The Record newspaper that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling.   'It was like he lost his mind,' she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. 'He said he saw things.'   Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun.   Senator-elect Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live in Puerto Rico, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting.   'They're very humble and very Christian people,' Cruz said. 'They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.'",

'Brad has been cleared by both the FBI and Child Services and it\u2019s unfortunate that they continue to behave in a way that only hurts the entire family,' they added.    Scroll down for video        The documents show Jolie accusing her estranged husband of 'publicly impugning' her character in new court documents that claim Pitt is 'terrified the public will learn the truth'.   The allegations came as Jolie approved of Pitt's request that their children's records be legally sealed.    Pitt, 53, and his legal team asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to seal all records relating to their six children, claiming their accessibility is a violation of privacy, on Wednesday.    Jolie, 41,  agreed with his motives but accused Pitt of using  court filings to deflect from his 'own role in the media storm that has engulfed' their children .   'There is no question that this case has been of extraordinary interest to the public since its inception,' read the papers, filed by Jolie's attorney Laura Wasser.    'And there is little doubt that (Pitt) would prefer to keep the entire case private, particularly given the detailed investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Children and Family Services into allegations of abuse.'    Wasser then goes on to claim that Jolie has not addressed 'each and every false allegation made by (Pitt)' in an effort to protect their children 'from additional tabloid fodder'.    'Her conduct in this case has been grossly mischaracterized by (Pitt)', the statement continues.    'Likely terrified that the public will learn the truth, (Pitt) is now casting blame at (Jolie) for the consequences of his own actions.'    Jolie's legal team then accuses Pitt of superfluous court filings that 'could have been avoided' and protected his children's privacy, but are instead a 'desperate effort to obscure the truth which threatens his reputation'.    The papers also claim that Pitt has refused to follow the couple's agreement that he will currently only have weekly therapeutic visits with his children.    Since October 2016, therapists have been present during each of Pitt's visits with his children Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.    The frequency and duration of these visits are being decided by the children's therapists, which the papers state were put in place by Jolie and Pitt after the infamous incident on a flight from Europe to California in September 2016.    Pitt and his family allegedly got into an argument aboard a private plane in September, causing an anonymous source to call the DCFS.    Pitt was exonerated in November by officials with the FBI and LA DCFS amid accusations he was physically abusive to Maddox during the flight from France.   Although further weekly therapeutic visits have been scheduled through the end of January, Jolie's team claims Pitt has made repeated requests for more.    The papers state that Pitt's legal team began requesting increased visitation in a non-therapeutic setting which 'was not recommended by the children's therapists and not agreed upon in the prior custody stipulation agreement'.    It states that it is up to the therapists to decide, based on each child's 'individual feelings and progress', when and how Pitt's visits can increase.    Aside from news of the documents, sources tell  People  magazine that Angelina's lawyers insist Pitt's accusations of her leaking information were only announced due to his fear of private information surfacing in the divorce proceedings.   'Yesterday's filing makes no sense legally,'  the source told DailyMail at the time.   'Everyone was surprised that he filed with the court because he already filed with the court before. Besides, Angelina had already signed an agreement to seal the court file. It protects the children and it also protects information about Brad.'    'All parties have already agreed and signed. The accusation that she is not protecting the privacy of her children is clearly false.'    'If Angelina wanted to detail what happened on the plane, she could have. Nothing has been released and Angelina has kept silent.'    Meanwhile, Pitt's lawyers are claiming that Jolie made public the names of her children's therapists and other mental health professionals.        It's the first time since Jolie's September 19 divorce filing in Los Angeles that Pitt has gone on the offensive against his estranged wife.   At the time of the parting, Pitt said that 'what matters most now is the well-being of' their six children, adding: 'I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.'   The ongoing strife has caused tension in the household amid the holiday season, according to an  In Touch Weekly  report, as an insider said that the children were at odds because Maddox and Pax had 'no interest in seeing their dad' amid the tough time.   'Some of the girls are accusing their older brother of being responsible for their not seeing Brad either,' the source said, while another insider told the publication that some of the kids 'can't understand why they're being kept away' from Pitt.   Pitt and Jolie - whose romance is believed to have begun during filming of  Mr & Mrs Smith, while he was still married to Jennifer Aniston, in 2005 - are due back in court next month for a hearing in the ongoing case.   The actor is requesting to share joint physical and legal custody of the six kids with Jolie, who wants sole physical custody with Pitt receiving scheduled visits.   Jolie - who currently retains temporary physical custody of the children - remains undaunted in her attempts to get sole custody of the kids.",

Former Asda worker Hayden Cross, 20, decided to pause his gender reassignment process so he could give birth.   He found a sperm donor on Facebook and became pregnant four months ago.   He will complete his transition, which will remove his breasts and ovaries, after his child is born.      He told the  Sun on Sunday : 'I want the baby to have the best. I'll be the greatest dad.'      Hayden, who lives in a council flat in Gloucester and receives unemployment benefits, has lived legally as man for three years.   He has been taking male hormones which have given him facial hair and a deeper voice.   Desperate to have a baby at some point in his life, he asked the NHS to freeze his eggs before he completed his transition.   But he was left devastated when doctors refused to give him the \u00a34,000 treatment and decided to look for a sperm donor online so he could give birth before he is no longer able.   He said: 'I faced the prospect of not becoming the man I am supposed to be, physically, or a dad.   'So I didn't feel like I had any choice but to have a baby now then get back to transitioning.   He said the anonymous sperm donor, who he didn't know, delivered the sperm to his door in a pot and he inserted it with a syringe because he could not afford a proper clinic.      Hayden said if the NHS had agreed to freeze his eggs then he would have waited until he was older and in a steady relationship before having a child.    He said that he will ensure he stays single during the child's formative years in order to keep matters as simple as possible.   He said: 'I am worried about how I will look and what people will think and say about me.   'There are a lot of small-minded people out there.'   Hayden went to an all girl's school in Gloucester but he was expelled at the age of 14, around the time his parents split up when his dad returned to taking drugs.   He said he didn't fit in, made mostly male friends and loved playing football.   He said he is bisexual and has dated both males and females but prefers males.   Before becoming pregnant, Hayden was on the NHS gender transition process which helps around 3,000 patients in England at a cost of \u00a322.72million or \u00a329,000 per patient.   He will be helped though his pregnancy by his his local \u00adhospital\u2019s NHS maternity services.    The first man in the world to become pregnant was Thomas Beatie, from Arizona, who gave birth to three children after having a sex change.   Mr Beatie was born as a woman, Tracy Lagondino, in Hawaii in 1974, but said he always felt like he wanted to be a man.   When he was in his twenties began having testosterone injections, giving him facial hair, a lower voice and altering his sexual organs.   In 2002 he had a mastectomy and legally became a man - but he chose to keep his vagina, uterus and other female sexual organs so the couple could have children, as his wife had had a hysterectomy.    Transgender men do have the capability to become pregnant themselves if they keep their uterus and ovaries in tact.   One such transgender man who decided to get pregnant was Thomas Beatie, of Arizona.   Beatie decided to get pregnant in 2008, after his then-wife was deemed infertile.    Beatie was born as a woman, Tracy Lagondino, in Hawaii in 1974 but began taking testosterone to become a man in his twenties.   In 2002, he legally transitioned into a man by undergoing a mastectomy but kept his vagina and uterus in tact for the possibility of having children in the future.   When he and his wife were ready, Beatie went off testosterone and conceived using a sperm donation.   The couple went on to have three children together: 7-year-old Susan Juliette Beatie, 8-year-old Austin Alexander Beatie and 9-year-old Jason James Beatie.   Beatie and his wife announced they were getting divorced in 2012.    'I have a very stable male gender identity. I see pregnancy as a process, and it doesn't define who I am. It's not a male or female desire to want to have a child - it's a human desire... I'm a person, and I have the right to have my own biological child,' Beatie said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.",

Scroll down for video     'Her bright smile and loving manner will be missed by all who had the fortune to know her.   'She rarely seemed to meet a stranger, rather she had a smile or a hug for all.She was a blessing in the lives of family and friends.   'She was always guided by her strong faith in God and remained very active in her church, Transfiguration Church.   'She worked at and led cursillos in the church to bring God's message to others, and she spoke to groups about her personal faith as a testament to the power of God's love for us.   'She will be terribly missed by her faith community. Her family asks for privacy at this time as we mourn her loss and support our father and each other in the coming days.   'We are truly appreciative of everyone's prayers and support during this difficult time.'     Her church in Georgia, where she lived, posted a tribute to Olga, praising her 'loving' and 'caring nature'.   Posting to its website, the Transfiguration Catholic Church said: 'Olga was so charming, calling everybody \"lovey\" or \"love\" in her unmistakable British accent.    'Her life revolved around her kids, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and hundreds of extended family at Transfiguration.'   Father Fernando Molina-Restrepo added: 'Olga was one of the most joyful, loving, caring and committed people I have ever met.   'This is a horrible tragedy for everyone here at Transfiguration, especially because Olga was so loved.   'Olga and Ralph have been members of our Transfiguration Family since October 1978.   'May God give consolation to all of the victims of this tragedy and may God give eternal rest to those who died. Especially to our beloved Olga. Peace.'     A parishioner said Olga and Ralph were 'the life of the party.'   Friends who attended church with Mrs Woltering spoke of their shock and horror at her killing on social media.   Jerry De Varennes wrote: 'Tragedy hit too close to home today. Transfiguration Church lost a very loving and caring woman in the Ft Lauderdale airport attack. Prayers lifted up for the soul of Olga Woltering and her family. Prayers also lifted up for a crazy and cruel world.'   Virginia Moran added: 'So very sad, Olga's ever present smile was infectious and brightened any day, she will be deeply missed and my prayers are with Ralph, her family, all those she touched, and all who were impacted by yesterday's senseless action.'   Diane Friesen said: 'Dear Ralph, wish there was something we could do to take away your pain. Olga was loved so much. Our hearts are broken.   'I'll always remember how she would say in her English accent, \"hello love\".'                Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq war veteran, was taken into custody and was pictured in handcuffs Saturday as police led him to the Broward County Main Jail, where he is held on suspicion of murder.    On Saturday authorities charged Santiago with committing an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death, which carries the death penalty or a prison sentence up to life.   He was also charged with two firearms offences and will appear in court on Monday.   It came as authorities in the US revealed more about the alleged shooter, who is alleged to have travelled to Fort Lauderdale specifically to carry out the shooting.   The FBI said Santiago had a gun confiscated after walking into the law enforcement agency's office in Anchorage, Alaska, in a distressed state.   However, it was returned to him in December after he underwent mental health checks.   They did not say if it was the same gun as used in the attack at the airport.   The attack happened in the baggage reclaim area just before 1pm local time, the Fort Lauderdale sheriff's office said.",

   "7. content": "In his latest Twitter rant, President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that 'only 'stupid' people or fools' would dismiss closer ties with Russia.     He added: 'We have enough problems without yet another one,' and said Russians would respect 'us far more' under his administration than they do with Barack Obama in the White House.    Trump remained unswayed after his classified briefing on an intelligence report that accused Moscow of meddling on his behalf in the election that catapulted him to power.    He recently criticized American intelligence agencies calling assessments 'a political witch hunt' after reports said the Kremlin was involved with the US election.   A classified report was presented to Trump on Friday, detailing Russian President Vladimir Putin's involvement and Moscow's 'clear preference' for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.    However, Trump remained unconvinced and continued to say closer ties will be one less problem for the US and perhaps both countries will work together to 'solve many of the great and pressing problems' of the world.    But even as intelligence officials are looking back to their reports on the election, and have predicted that Russia isn't done intruding in U.S. politics and policy-making.   Immediately after the Nov. 8 election, Russia began a 'spear-phishing' campaign to try to trick people into revealing their email passwords, targeting U.S. government employees and think tanks that specialize in national security, defense and foreign policy, the report said.    The report was the most detailed public account to date of Russian efforts to hack the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats, among them Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.    The unclassified version said Russian government provided emails to  WikiLeaks even though the website's founder, Julian Assange, has denied that it got the emails it released from the Russian government.    The report noted that the emails could have been passed through middlemen.   Russia also used state-funded propaganda and paid 'trolls' to make nasty comments on social media services, the report said.    Moreover, intelligence officials believe that Moscow will apply lessons learned from its activities in the election to put its thumbprint on future elections in the United States and allied nations.   The public report was minus classified details that intelligence officials shared with President Barack Obama on Thursday.    In a brief interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Trump said he 'learned a lot' from his discussions with intelligence officials, but he declined to say whether he accepted their assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf.   After finally seeing the intelligence behind the claims of the outgoing Obama administration, Trump released a one-page statement that did not address whether Russia sought to meddle.    Instead, he said: 'there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election' and that there 'was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.'     Intelligence officials have never made that claim.    In fact, the report stated that the Department of Homeland Security did not think that the systems that were targeted or compromised by Russian actors were 'involved in vote tallying.'   The report released publicly lacked details about how the U.S. learned what it said it knows, such as any intercepted conversations or electronic messages among Russian leaders, including Putin, or about specific hacker techniques or digital tools the U.S. may have traced back to Russia in its investigations.    Exactly how the U.S. monitors its adversaries in cyberspace is a closely guarded secret. Revealing such details could help foreign governments further obscure their activities.   The unclassified version included footnotes acknowledging that it 'does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.'    It said its conclusions were identical to the classified version, which was more detailed.   The unclassified report said the Russian effort was both political and personal.   'Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency,' it said.    'We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.'   Putin most likely wanted to discredit Clinton because he blames her for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he resents her for disparaging comments she has made about him, the report said.   Before the intelligence agencies completed their assessment, Obama announced sanctions against Russia. Trump has not said whether he will undo them once he takes office, but lawmakers are calling for more punitive measures against Russia and have little to no appetite to roll back any current sanctions.   Trump said he would appoint a team within three months of taking office to develop a plan to 'aggressively combat and stop cyber attacks.'   On Saturday, he said he wanted retired Sen. Dan Coats to be national intelligence director, describing the former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee as the right person to lead the new administration's 'ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.'   Coats, in a statement released by Trump's transition team, said: 'There is no higher priority than keeping America safe, and I will utilize every tool at my disposal to make that happen.'",

At least that's what some local New York City democrats are hoping.     Rumors started swirling on Wednesday when  Newsmax  reported a former city Democratic elected official said she was 'talking about it.'    Across the five boroughs, 79 percent of voters were with her during the general election.    In the democratic primary, Mrs Clinton earned 64 percent of the vote against Bernie Sanders.    Some local politicians are feeling blas\u00e9 faire about Mayor Bill de Blasio. They say they are ready for Mrs Clinton to run for Mayor of New York.   New York Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf told Newsmax: '[Clinton] is wildly popular among New Yorkers \u2014 so much so that were she to file, de Blasio would have to file his retirement papers on the same day.'   She would certainly be familiar with the state having served as senator from 2001 to 2009.    Gregory Floyd, president of Teamsters Local 237 told the  New York Post : 'If Hillary entered the race, she would be the best candidate.'   'I would support her because we need a change in New York City.'    'Hillary would be a better mayor than de Blasio. Every week we hear about investigations about fund-raising and city property being given away to real estate developers.'   If the rumor is true, Mrs Clinton would have a tighter control over the area where Donald Trump has a fair amount of real estate.   The  New York Times  joked about the potential humor in the proposal saying: 'Imagine the fun: City building inspectors start to show up daily at Trump Tower, where they find a wobbly beam here, a missing smoke detector there, outdated wiring all over the place.'   The New York mayoral election will be held November 7, 2017.",

A laughing Rankin, 56, whose photograph hangs prominently on the wall, shrugs off the good-humoured insults with the ease of a longstanding friend \u2013 which is what, of course, the pub, tucked away in a quiet lane off the city\u2019s bustling heart, has become over the past 30 years since he dreamt up Rebus.   Within the next few days, the author would normally be preparing to start writing his next Rebus book \u2013 but with 2017 being such a landmark year in the life of his best-known character, he is about to set off on an international tour instead, beginning in the US next month.   Ahead of the anniversary, Rankin reveals a three-day RebusFest will be held on June 30 in Edinburgh, featuring some of the bands loved by both himself and Rebus and are mentioned throughout the 21 books. Screenings and appearances by actors involved in the TV series are also planned.   Rankin also says the ageing Rebus has made him acknowledge his own mortality, how negotiations are under way to bring the character back to TV \u2013 and hints he might even find time to write a new book later this year.   But before all that, Rankin, whose latest book Rather Be the Devil was published two months ago, is looking forward to a holiday in St Lucia with his wife Miranda. Rebus, of course, will be there in spirit \u2013 whether they like it or not.   Rankin says: \u2018It feels a bit strange not to be preparing for my next book. Fans want another one. Rebus is so real to so many people and the truth is they often get very disappointed when they meet me because I\u2019m not him.   \u2018He\u2019s much more interesting and more complicated than me. It\u2019s hugely flattering that people want to spend time with him. I\u2019ve had people saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s the 30th anniversary, I\u2019ve been with you since book one\u201d. That\u2019s the reality, he\u2019s been with them for half their lives. It\u2019s terrifying.\u2019   As he talks about Rebus, discussing his recent \u2018health issues\u2019, his bad habits \u2013 smoking and drinking \u2013 even his musical tastes, it\u2019s hard not to get swept up in the phenomenon, whether you are a fan or not.   So, if Rebus is \u2018real\u2019, does he have a view on Brexit? Tickled by the idea, Rankin\u2019s eyes dance as he says: \u2018Rebus is not political, so I think it\u2019s an irrelevance to him. Why would it affect him anyway? He doesn\u2019t have a passport, so he doesn\u2019t go abroad, he doesn\u2019t need euros.\u2019   Rankin\u2019s books, however, do often weave current events, from the G8 summit in Scotland in 2005 to the independence referendum of 2014, into their storylines.   Rebus may not have much to say on Brexit \u2013 but Rankin, who usually steers clear of political pronouncements, is clearly rattled by the outcome of the EU referendum.   He said: \u2018We were on holiday in Greece and my wife stayed up to watch the Brexit result, while I went to bed. There were six of us in the villa and when I came downstairs next morning, it was like a f***ing funeral.   \u2018I said, \u201cEverybody all right?\u201d My wife said, \u201cWe\u2019ve left\u201d. I said, \u201cWhat do you mean, we\u2019ve left?\u201d Our friend, who we were staying with, is Greek but he\u2019s a dentist in Edinburgh. He was asking what did it mean for him, for the people he employed? Nobody could take it in.   \u2018It\u2019s not our generation that\u2019s going to have to deal with this, it\u2019s the next generation. We\u2019ve made a helluva mess. It\u2019s not really democracy if they don\u2019t make everybody vote. They should have made it compulsory for something that big. What you end up with is 72 per cent of the population across the UK voting on something with massive implications for everybody.\u2019   Rankin smiles ruefully as he says he slept through the victory of Donald Trump too. \u2018You know how they say, \u201cMay you live in interesting times\u201d. Well, sometimes times are just too interesting.   \u2018God, it\u2019s unbelievable. I went to bed thinking there was no way he was getting in, I woke up to my wife crying, \u201cTrump\u2019s in\u201d. I tell you, I\u2019m never sleeping again.\u2019   He\u2019s due in the US shortly after Trump is inaugurated as President. \u2018It\u2019s the closest we\u2019ll get to The West Wing,\u2019 he says.   \u2018Things can only get better, as they say. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to use all my money and all my talent to build a bunker at the moment. I\u2019m going to fill it up with books, music and booze.   \u2018We\u2019ll dig ourselves in for the Trump presidency and come out in four years\u2019 time. All that will be left will be scorpions and Keith Richards.\u2019   Rankin is in negotiations to bring Rebus back to TV after buying back the rights as he was annoyed by the editing for the last series, starring Ken Stott.   \u2018They were turning 400-page books into a one-hour episode with adverts,\u2019 he says, disgusted.   An earlier series, starring John Hannah as a young Rebus, he felt was much fairer to his writing.   \u2018So, we\u2019re talking to various people. It could be a while though. There are so many cops on TV just now. I\u2019m not in a hurry. It will have to be right before I\u2019ll let them do it.\u2019   He adds with a Cheshire cat grin: \u2018I\u2019m a great admirer of Scandinavian crime dramas, which are allowed to play out over a number of hours. About 20 would be good.\u2019   Regarding a new Rebus novel, Rankin says: \u2018The second half of this year is looking a bit quiet, so I might find the time then.\u2019   Becoming the No1 best-seller for fiction in the US, Rankin reveals, is still one of his biggest dreams. But he says: \u2018I\u2019ve not cracked America yet. There\u2019s always something to chase, no matter how successful an author is. But I\u2019m happy where I am. I get to do a book when I want to, I get as much free time as I want, I get to buy lots of LPs, go on lots of holidays. I\u2019m around for my family and I make a living as well. It\u2019s pretty good.\u2019   His first novel, Knots & Crosses, which was rejected by five publishers before being accepted, introduced readers to Rebus as a 40-year-old, heavy-smoking, heavy-drinking, divorced father of one. But it would be the tenth Rebus book, Dead Souls, before he made it into the Top Ten best-sellers list, finally reaping the rewards of his hard graft.   Until 2007, Rankin, who is originally from Cardenden in Fife but now lives in Edinburgh\u2019s Merchiston, stuck to real-time ageing and retired Rebus, aged 60, in Exit Music. But five years later, with improvements in DNA leading to successes in cold cases, he had a reason to bring him back \u2013 to the delight of fans.   So what are the omens now for Rebus? Rankin admits he\u2019s managed to \u2018slow down time\u2019 in recent books, but there is no doubt age is creeping up on Rebus and, indirectly, preying on the author\u2019s mind.   \u2018He\u2019s about 66, he should be 70,\u2019 says Rankin. \u2018I\u2019ve slowed the clock drastically just to squeeze another book or two out of him before it gets ridiculous.   \u2018There\u2019s no denying the latest books have all been focused on mortality. He\u2019s feeling his age now. He\u2019s not the guy he was in the early books. Previously, he could use his physical presence to intimidate people. He doesn\u2019t get into a fight now because he knows he\u2019ll lose.   \u2018These latest books have Rebus coming to terms with whether there is a role for him in this shiny new world.\u2019   Is that how Rankin sees things going for himself? \u2018If you were a psychoanalyst, I guess you would say it\u2019s all there in the books. I\u2019d be told, \u201cYou\u2019re worried about dying, you\u2019re fretting about it\u201d. Partly, they would be right. My mum died of cancer at 58 and I\u2019m 56, so you do start to think about that stuff.\u2019   He blames his wife for Rebus\u2019 present gloomy health prospects. \u2018It\u2019s all her fault. She\u2019s been saying for years Rebus has had a lucky run, bearing in mind his smoking, drinking and lack of exercise.   \u2018Miranda has a good friend who\u2019s a GP, so I asked her what she would expect him to present if he walked into her surgery. She went through half a dozen things, some more horrendous than others, from cancer to chronic pulmonary disease, before I settled on the latter. So now Rebus needs an inhaler. Not exactly life-threatening, but life-limiting. Next book, I have to bear that in mind.\u2019   One book Rankin won\u2019t be working on is Sir Sean Connery\u2019s autobiography, which the pair discussed a few years ago. \u2018He was a big fan of my books and had an inkling we could maybe do a book together. It was just an idea and, as these things sometimes do, it didn\u2019t go any further. But I remember I felt I should take along a DVD to get him to sign it.\u2019   Unfortunately, his film of choice was The League of Extraordinary Gentleman \u2013 the movie in which Sir Sean had such a spectacular falling-out with director Stephen Norrington he quit acting for good. Rankin recalls: \u2018I grabbed a DVD because I thought I\u2019d better get his autograph, but the only bloody film I could find was that one, the last one he made because he hated it so much.   \u2018I said to Sir Sean, \u201cDo you mind signing this for me?\u201d. He took it from me, signed it and handed it back, saying, \u201cThe director was a f***ing mad man\u201d. I\u2019ve still got the signed DVD. I bet there aren\u2019t too many signed copies of that around.\u2019   Rankin feels fortunate he will never have to worry about money, thanks to Rebus. Particularly because the younger of his two sons, Kit, 22, suffers from Angelman syndrome, a disorder which causes severe disabilities. He uses a wheelchair and is looked after in a care facility for young adults.   Rankin says: \u2018When he was first diagnosed, we were living in France and I was writing my eighth Rebus book, Black and Blue. I channelled all my frustration and rage on to the page. All the big questions. Why us?\u2019   The award-winning book secured Rankin\u2019s reputation as an author.   Now he says: \u2018It took me a long time to get famous, to get rich. If it had happened overnight, I probably would have been insufferable. But by the time I did, I wasn\u2019t in the first flush of youth any more and I had kids. So you don\u2019t buy the Lamborghini, you don\u2019t have the huge, expensive holidays.   \u2018It\u2019s lovely to be able to help my family. I don\u2019t have to worry about Kit getting the equipment he needs. He\u2019s as happy as Larry now. Every day is full of fun, people looking after him amazingly well. He\u2019s so busy we have to make an appointment to see him.\u2019   But what\u2019s in store for Rebus? \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to him. He can\u2019t run around solving crimes when he\u2019s 70 or in an old folks\u2019 home.   \u2018Besides, he might see me out. People are still writing about Sherlock Holmes.\u2019",

   "7. content": "Dozens of celebrities turned out to party until 4am at the White House in a farewell bash that saw the likes of Paul McCartney, Meryl Streep and SJP tear up the dancefloor.     The strictly VIP guestlist were banned from recording inside the party where Barack and Michelle served chicken and waffles to weary partygoers in the early hours of Saturday morning.   But that didn't stop A-list attendees from spilling the beans and their selfies to social media revealing how many of the Hollywood elite turned out to say goodbye to the beloved first family.       Scroll down for video      Pharrell and Solange were said to have performed at the event and President Obama was rumored to have dominated the dance floor with the likes of Robert De Niro, Common and Usher.   Solange, the sister of Beyonce, said that it was 'truly the ultimate, ultimate honor.'   She continued: 'We will miss your excellence, your grace, and the phenomenal legacy you have let us all share.'   The bash was well attended by artists, philanthropists, activists, and executives, many of whom made the trip to Washington D.C. just to saw their farewells.    Guests snacked on chicken and waffles until 4am while the likes of Bradley Cooper and Magic Johnson chatted beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln.     The evening was likely bittersweet for the first family, with  Donald Trump 's inauguration less than two weeks away.   'It's something that they've done in the past and something I anticipate they're going to do again tomorrow,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday.    'Over the years, the President and first lady have on occasion - not frequently, but on occasion - they've hosted parties at the White House for their friends,' he continued.   'And I anticipate this will be the last one that they have. They've got some packing to do.'    Many stars found the evening emotional as they faced the impending loss of Obama in the oval office.   Comedian and TV host Billy Eichner posted a touching tribute to the President in his Instagram post, after getting the opportunity to discuss Obama's work with the LGBT community last night.   'He told me it was one of the things he's most proud of. I told him we will love and appreciate him forever. He told me there's a lot of work we still need to do,' Eichner said.   'Setting aside for a moment the sadness and anger I feel about the next administration, this was one of the greatest moments and nights of my life.'     Rapper Wale and songstress Kelly Rowland were among the first to post photos on social media as they arrived at the White House Friday night to bid the Obamas farewell.   The pair posed with host and actor Terrence J, film producer Will Packer and TV personality La La Anthony before the doors opened at 8.30pm.   Singer Nick Jonas also showed off in a dark grey suit with a black turtle neck underneath.     Singer-songwriter Jordin Sparks gushed about bringing her father to the White House in a sweet Instagram post.   'Getting to take my Dad to the White House\u2026Priceless. Soooo excited! Cheers! *drops mic*,' Sparks, 27, posted on social media with their selfie.   Jill Scott also posed for a photo as she made her way to the White House festivities.   Chrissy Teigen  and John Legend, Meryl Streep, Al Sharpton, Tyler Perry, Chris Rock, David Letterman, Tom Hanks, Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder were also in attendance.    Star Wars directors George Lucas and JJ Abrams arrived to the party as well shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Questlove, who deejayed the evening.   Writer Tom Healy posted a reflective paragraph on social media about his evening with the Obamas.   He said: 'Hard to believe Fred and I were there. Even harder to believe that all too soon, this great President and First Lady will not be.    'They have served our country with grace, wisdom, dignity, love -- and a glam, groovy style we will not see again for a long, long time.   'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, First Lady Obama.'      The Obamas also invited  Beyonce  and Jay Z, Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, and Oprah Winfrey.   The party would have been a sad moment for both the President and his wife as well as many of the guests, who have given their open contempt for  Donald Trump , will not likely head back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for at least four years.    And those hoping for a glimpse of Obama getting down in the Oval Office are out of luck as cell phones will be strictly prohibited and checked at the door.   The Washington Post  reported that Samuel L Jackson and Gayle King were also among the guetes.   Chance the Rapper confirmed he would be in attendance when he tweeted Wednesday: 'Bout to fly 21 hours to DC to bid farewell to the greatest president in US history. God bless you @POTUS.'   Obama and the First Lady have become incredibly close with the 23-year-old rapper, who hails from their hometown of Chicago.   The Obamas are believed to have footed the bill for the party themselves.   The soiree was one of his last as president. He is now preparing to head to Chicago where on Tuesday he will deliver his farewell address after two terms in office.   The party guests will no doubt stay far away when Trump is inaugurated on January 20, an event that has failed to draw any of the big names Obama did during his two ceremonies.       In 2013, Obama was sworn into office at a ceremony that featured Beyonce performing The Star Spangled Banner and Kelly Clarkson singing My Country 'Tis of Thee.   Trump will have the incredibly talented but much lesser known teenage singer Jackie Evancho performing at his inauguration, and she is the lone name of note confirmed for the event.   Among those who attended the final White House party, none has been more vocal about their disdain for Trump's policies and rhetoric than Springsteen.   The New Jersey rocker appeared on an episode of  WTF With Marc Maron  that was released on Tuesday, and during the hour-long podcast he spoke about his fears and concerns about the future of the country during and after a Trump presidency.   'I've felt disgust before, but never the kind of fear that you feel now,' Springsteen said of Trump and the administration he has been building over the past month.   'It's as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job? Forget about where they are ideologically. Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such responsibility?'       Earlier on Friday, First Lady Michelle delivered her final speech in the East Room, where she  hosted 50 school counselors and several stars at the 2017 School Counselor of the Year event.   She choked back tears while addressing the young people of the audience, saying: 'Don't be afraid. Be focused. Be determined. Be hopeful. Be empowered.    'Empower yourself with a good education. Then get out there and use that education to build a country worthy of you boundless promise. Lead by example with hope; never fear.'   She also said that her time spent as the First Lady has been 'the greatest honor' of her life, and to her supporters, she hoped to have made them proud.",

   "7. content": "Lauren Harries teeters into the lobby of the London hotel where we meet, her long, gym-honed legs accentuated by vertiginous heels and a skirt so short that it makes the commissionaire blush.   A snug cashmere sweater accentuates her large bust and tiny 24 in waist.   Her hair \u2013 a tumble of blonde curls \u2013 and her striking broad smile are the only giveaways of something still more remarkable than her appearance.   For Lauren first sprang into the public eye as a precocious 12-year-old antiques expert called James, who famously appeared on the Antiques Roadshow and Wogan.    Dressed in prissy velvet suits and bow ties, he looked and sounded like a polytechnic lecturer in a young boy\u2019s body.   That was in the late 1980s \u2013 and the intervening years have not been easy. Bullying and intimidation at school led to depression, agoraphobia, a nervous breakdown and three suicide attempts before Lauren underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2002, which was, she says, \u2018like being reborn\u2019.   Even this new life as a woman has been, at times, traumatic, as she explains today in a rare interview.   Within weeks of her sex-change surgery, Lauren was raped so terribly in a London hotel that she required hospital treatment.   Today she claims to have the body and the confident female identity that she had always wanted, and a very different, nascent media career as a transgender television personality and singer.   Eyes closed and tugging nervously at her hair, Lauren, 38, says she is speaking now because she wants to be seen not just as any woman, but as a role model for young transgender people \u2013 proof that another life is possible, despite all the difficulties she has been through.   She has spent a lifetime of being unusual. She was only four when her family spotted her uncanny talent for buying pieces of porcelain for pennies in charity shops and at car boot sales and then selling them on for thousands \u2013 a gift that led to that brush with fame.   But there were other signs that the youngster was, in her mother\u2019s words \u2018special\u2019, and at the age of eight her parents took her to see a doctor. \u2018I was small for my age and not growing as fast as my brothers,\u2019 Lauren explains.   \u2018Looking back I think I always knew that I was a woman. While my brothers Adam and Patrick loved playing with Transformers and trucks, I was happy huddled in a corner paying with My Little Pony and china dolls.   \u2018I used to watch Superman and wanted to be Lois Lane \u2013 but I didn\u2019t know what it meant.\u2019   As the years went by, the problems grew increasingly serious.   \u2018From the age of 16, I didn\u2019t know who I was,\u2019 she continues. \u2018I felt suddenly trapped in a burning building and I couldn\u2019t see a way out.\u2019   She admits to exploring the gay scene only to discover that she was interested in \u2018straight\u2019 men. But, as she bluntly puts it, \u2018they didn\u2019t fancy me\u2019.   \u2018It began to dawn on me that I felt like a woman, but I didn\u2019t have anyone to advise me. I had to figure it out by myself through the internet.\u2019   Lauren found a surgeon on the net and organised the operation, raising money through her media appearances. But the response to the sex change was vicious at times. In 2005, three years after the operation, a gang of men attacked Lauren, her father and one of her brothers in the family home in Cardiff, shouting transphobic slurs.   \u2018It was horrible and frightening,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018We had bricks lobbed through every window of our house and we had death threats. We had about five or six years of hate thrown at us.\u2019   Her personal life was troubled, too, finding she attracted the kind of men who were curious but uncaring. \u2018I thought that after the surgery, my life would change for the better and I would find someone to love me. I really believed that I would find my own Superman and he would sweep me off my feet and make my life complete.   \u2018Society teaches us that no woman is complete without a partner, and I wanted to be complete.\u2019   She was not long into her new body when she was violently raped after befriending a couple in a pub in Chelsea \u2013 something she has not felt able to discuss before.   \u2018It was very traumatic \u2013 straight after surgery,\u2019 she reveals. \u2018I was lonely and I was in a bar and met a nice-looking man who paid me lots of compliments. He said he had heard me on the radio and that I was very brave. He introduced me to his wife. I thought they were just fans. I ended up drinking with them \u2013 I was lonely and vulnerable.   \u2018At the end of the evening, the man took me back to my hotel and raped me.   \u2018I never reported it to the police \u2013 I never thought it would do any good. I suppose I thought they might think I had asked for it. That was not a very good start.   \u2018Admittedly, I did not always make the best choices after my transition. I went out on my own to test myself and at times it was quite brutal. But it made me realise that I should concentrate on my career and not be out searching for Mr Right.\u2019   So Lauren returned to live at the sprawling family home in Cardiff with her father Mark, a failed businessman who was jailed for insurance fraud after burning down his struggling shop, her mother Kate, and her brothers Adam, 40, and Patrick, 34.   She describes them as her support group. And if her fashion sense is a little over the top, then a forthcoming appearance on a new Channel 5 show called Celebrity 100 Per Cent Hotter could help her tone things down a little. The programme, which bills itself as a \u2018make-under show\u2019, uses professional stylists to help those prone to over-dressing to find a more natural look.   However, Lauren is yet to be convinced by the results. \u2018I was blindfolded while they did the make-under,\u2019 she says. \u2018When I took the mask off, my hair and make-up was fab. But if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m not sure about the clothes. They made me feel very feminine, but I\u2019ve got gorgeous legs. I go to the gym twice a week and I don\u2019t want to hide them.\u2019 Hence, one assumes, the mini-skirt.   \u2018Gender change was not so common when I was growing up,\u2019 she continues. \u2018Back then, there was no glamorous celebrity representative like Caitlyn Jenner. God bless her for helping to raise awareness.\u2019   Jenner, of course, won an Olympic decathlon gold medal as Bruce Jenner, had six children by three different wives and became stepfather to the Kardashian clan before deciding to become a woman.   But Lauren argues that despite her high profile, Caitlyn is not a \u2018real\u2019 transgender woman. \u2018It really upsets me because she has not been through a true rebirth. She\u2019s not had the anatomical changes, down below, to qualify. Putting on a dress doesn\u2019t make you a woman. She should technically be called a pre-op trans.\u2019   Lauren also claims to have had a fling with comedian Russell Brand in 2006 \u2013 something Brand vehemently denies.   \u2018It went on for six months,\u2019 she claims. \u2018He can deny it all he wants, but we both know the truth.\u2019   Sadly, for her, she will play no part in this year\u2019s series, which started last week.   Having been hired to act as a judge and mentor for the current batch of residents, she was quietly dropped last month after she inadvertently leaked news of her participation on Twitter.   \u2018They said that I might leak stories to the press,\u2019 Lauren says indignantly. \u2018It was disrespectful, cold and cruel. I was very hurt.\u2019   Away from her career, Lauren also tells me that she is reviving her efforts to find love.   \u2018I would like a relationship,\u2019 she says, a hint of desperation in her voice.   \u2018I want to be seen as a woman and not be judged unfavourably because I wasn\u2019t born one. No one puts themselves though dangerous, life-threatening surgery just to be different. It is a desperate need that you either fulfil or be miserable.   \u2018I was bullied at school because I was shy and sensitive.   \u2018In my teens I was so lost and confused that I tried to commit suicide three times.   \u2018I don\u2019t go a day without prejudice and discrimination. It would be wonderful if we could reach a stage where people were not categorised by their gender.\u2019   Celebrity 100 Per Cent Hotter starts on Channel 5 on Tuesday at 10pm.",

'If confirmed as Director of National Intelligence, he will provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration's ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.'   The announcement comes a day after the Republican president-elect met the country's leading intelligence agency chiefs, including the current director of national intelligence, James Clapper, and CIA chief John Brennan.   The chiefs told him that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a vast cyber attack against mainly Democratic organizations aimed at helping install Trump in the White House.   Trump largely dismissed the findings after telling the New York Times before the meeting that the accusations are part of a 'political witch-hunt' against him.   The selection of Coats, 73, may go some way toward reassuring those critical of Trump's praise for Putin and stated desire to improve relations with Russia.   Coats, who served as a Republican senator from Indiana from 1989 to 1999, and then from 2011 to the end of his term on Tuesday, was one of six US legislators and three White House aides blacklisted by Moscow in 2014 in reprisal for US sanctions placed on the country for its seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.   The former senator, who had advocated tough sanctions against Moscow, has called the ban an honor.   He was US ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005 under the George W. Bush administration, and served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as well as economy-related committees during the past six years.   His nomination will have to pass Senate confirmation.   Created after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the DNI oversees coordination between disparate agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency and others, acting as the president's principal adviser on their work.   US media reported earlier this week that Trump's transition team is working on a plan to scale down the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.   However, the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, has called the reports 'false'.",

Ms Mills, 24, admits: \u2018My problem with the word clean is that it has become too complicated. It has become too loaded.   \u2018When I first read the term, it meant natural, unprocessed. Now it doesn\u2019t mean that at all. It means diet. It means fad.\u2019   Ms Mills appears with Cambridge University scientist Dr Giles Yeo in a BBC Horizon documentary to be broadcast later this month.   Biochemist Dr Yeo calls into question the validity of healthy eating gurus such as Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, and Natasha Corrett and Vicki Edgson, authors of the Honestly Healthy series of books.   The Hemsley sisters champion cutting out all grains such as wheat, barley and rye as a way of avoiding gluten, which can be damaging to people with coeliac disease.   Dr Yeo said: \u2018If you are going to give such extreme dietary advice, you\u2019ve got to have proof. Otherwise, all you are doing is stoking fear about a food group most people shouldn\u2019t have to worry about.\u2019   The Hemsleys declined to appear on Horizon but issued a statement saying: \u2018Grains are abundant in a modern diet. Our recipes celebrate other ingredients.\u2019   Another growing trend among clean eaters is \u2018alkaline eating\u2019. According to Honestly Healthy, meat, dairy and processed foods create acid in the body and these put a burden on the liver and kidneys.   Alkaline foods, however, including broccoli, kale and avocado, are said to be easier to digest, and create an \u2018alkaline state\u2019 in the body which is said to cure ailments.   In her book Honestly Healthy Cleanse, Corrett writes a glowing citation of American alternative medicine guru Robert O. Young, saying he discovered \u2018that eating a plant-based diet free from processed foods can help to cure diseases in the body\u2019.   Young stands accused of offering false hope to cancer patients, including British Army captain Naima Houder-Mohammed, 27. She was given six months to live after being diagnosed with breast cancer.   More than \u00a360,000 was raised so that she could attend sessions at Young\u2019s pH Miracle Ranch in California.

   "7. content": "The suspected killer in the Ft. Lauderdale rampage, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, was charged on Saturday with performing an act of violence at an airport, which could earn him the death penalty if he is convicted. \n Santiago was charged with an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death and weapons charges. \n Earlier, the FBI announced that Santiago apparently traveled to the airport for the purpose of carrying out the bloody rampage. \n Santiago told investigators that he planned the attack, buying a one-way ticket to the Fort Lauderdale airport, a federal complaint said. Authorities don't know why he chose his target and have not ruled out terrorism. \n Terrorism may have been a \"potential motivation\" for the attack on Friday that killed five people, Special Agent in Charge George Piro said during a news conference.   \n Later in the afternoon, police in Alaska said they had returned a handgun to the Florida airport shooting suspect which was temporarily taken from him when he underwent a mental evaluation late last year, according to a Reuters report. \n Anchorage Police Chief Christopher Tolley said it was not immediately clear if it was the same gun used in Friday's deadly rampage. Officials told a news conference the gun was returned to the suspect because the Iraq war veteran had not committed a crime. \n Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the  Sun Sentinel reported . \n VIDEO: SEN. RUBIO REACTS TO AIRPORT SHOOTING  \n \n \n \n \n \n The suspected shooter had a history of mental health problems -- some of which followed his military service in Iraq -- and was receiving psychological treatment at his home in Alaska, his relatives said. \n FBI investigators questioned Santiago for hours. Piro said investigators were scouring the 26-year-old suspect's social media footprint and looking into where he'd traveled before. \n Santiago was not on any no-fly list, according to the FBI. He allegedly carried out the attack with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, Piro added. \n FT. LAUDERDALE SHOOTING SUSPECT SAID HE WAS FORCED TO WATCH ISIS VIDEOS \n Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said six people were wounded in the attack -- not eight, as officials had said Friday. Three were in the intensive care unit and three were in good condition, Israel told reporters. \n \"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good,\" Santiago's uncle, Hernan Rivera,  told The Record newspaper . \n Santiago deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. \n In recent years, Santiago -- a new dad, family said -- had been living in Anchorage, Alaska, his brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press from Puerto Rico. Bryan Santiago said his brother's girlfriend had recently called the family to alert them to his treatment. \n In November, Esteban told FBI agents in Alaska that the government was controlling his mind and was forcing him to watch Islamic State group videos, a law enforcement official said. The official was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation by name and spoke Friday on condition of anonymity. \n The FBI agents notified the police after the interview with Esteban Santiago, who took him in for a mental health evaluation. \n Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. \n \"We have not talked for the past three weeks,\" Bryan Santiago said. \"That's a bit unusual ... I'm in shock. He was a serious person ... He was a normal person.\" \n Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. \n Former neighbor Ursula Candelario recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \"He was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\" she said. \"We're in shock. I couldn't believe it,\" said Candelario. \n While in Iraq, Santiago cleared roads of improvised explosive devices and at least two members of his company were killed, spokesman Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead told The New York Times. He was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. \n Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead told the AP. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \"unsatisfactory performance,\" said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman. His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. \n She would not elaborate on his discharge, but the Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. \n Still, he'd had some successes during his military career, being awarded a number of medals and commendations including the Iraq Campaign Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. \n His uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago after his arrest at the Fort Lauderdale airport.  FBI agents arrived at their house to question them, and reporters swarmed around. \n Maria Ruiz told The Record that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling. \n \"It was like he lost his mind,\" she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. \"He said he saw things.\" \n Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun. \n Santiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend's Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents. \n A month later municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. \n Law enforcement officers were at the girlfriend's home Friday afternoon, and officers guarding the property outside told a reporter who approached the home to step away. \n Senator-elect Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live in Puerto Rico, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting. \n \"They're very humble and very Christian people,\" Cruz said of Esteban Santiago's brother and mother. \"They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.\" \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Starnes wrote in his opinion column that Kerwin was frustrated after the 2016 election when 'militant liberals tried to burn down Portland'.    He also expressed that it was made worse when one of his favorite singers, Bruce Springsteen, raged against Trump supporters and suggested he appealed to un-American tendencies.    Because of the sign, he said that 'liberals' have all boycotted his store, but that he doesn't care.   He told Starnes: 'I've got a lot of great conservatives here and they support my shop.'    When  four black suspects kidnapped and tortured a mentally challenged man on Facebook live , Kerwin decided it was 'one of the last straws' and decided to post a giant sign on the front of his shop.     He also called CNN 'Comedy News Network, Fake News all the Time, Propaganda for Liberals.'",

   "7. content": "FUNCTIONAL FITNESS   WHAT : Functional 45 \u2013 or F45 as it is better known \u2013 emerged in Australia where it has gained a cult following among celebrity fans including Hugh Jackman and Nicole Richie. It is based on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with 45 seconds' exercise and 15 seconds' rest in a constant circuit for 45 minutes (including a mid-way rest). There are several types of F45 classes, with names such as Athletica, Romans, Brooklyn and Wingman, carried out in a group setting.   WHY : HIIT training boosts metabolism and burns fat, meaning you lose weight but not muscle. As F45 exercises can be carried out using just bodyweight or with equipment, anyone can join in and adapt it to their fitness level.   WHERE : There are 450 F45 studios in 18 countries, but so far just one in the UK. However, with the London Bridge location becoming more popular, several new London studios are set to open this year. More information at f45training.co.uk   MIX IT UP   WHAT : The big fitness trend for 2017 will be combo or fusion classes. These mix different types of training into one class, such as HIIT, Pilates and strength exercises. Such classes include Boom Cycle, combining spinning and boxing, Pao-la's BodyBarre fusing boxing and barre, PHIIT, which mixes Pilates and high-intensity interval training, and Balates \u2013 a combination of barre and Pilates.   WHY : By combining different types of training, you get a 'complete' workout which, though shorter, is more intense to fit in with busy schedules.   WHERE : Paola's BodyBarre is taught in several locations across London (paolasbodybarre.com) while Balates classes are held at Gymbox (gymbox.com). PHIIT has a studio in Fulham.   STRETCH A BIT FURTHER   WHAT : Gyrotonic training was created in the 1970s by professional ballet dancer Julio Horvath as a 'yoga for dancers'. He used it to rehabilitate himself after a herniated vertebral disc and torn Achilles tendon. The training is carried out using a piece of equipment called the Pulley Tower \u2013 which looks more like a medieval stretching rack \u2013 and mixes yoga and t'ai chi with martial arts and dance in gentle movements.   WHY : Gyrotonic training aims to decompress the joints, stabilise the body and co-ordinate breathing. Using the Pulley Tower, the exercises stretch, strengthen and lengthen the muscles in one go, while being kind to joints.   WHERE : To find a studio nearest you, visit gyrotonic.co.uk.   JUMP AROUND   WHAT : Freejumping \u2013 a kind of trampolining \u2013 is set to explode in 2017. Also known as 'antigravity cardio' sessions, these trampoline classes are miles away from jumping on a rebounder to boost your pelvic floor. Celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly hit trampolining classes to burn fat and stay slim and limber.   WHY : Jumping on a trampoline is healthier for joints as there is no impact against a hard surface. It is also said to be three times more effective than jogging when it comes to strengthening muscles and burning calories.   WHERE : There are several freejumping and trampolining studios cropping up in the UK. See oxygenfreejumping. co.uk for details of centres across the country.   GET OFF THE FENCE   WHAT : Looking for something different? Try Urban Escrima. Escrima, invented in the 1500s, is derived from the Spanish word for fencing and is the national martial art of the Philippines. Participants use both canes and hand techniques in combat classes specially developed for fitness enthusiasts and martial-arts fans.   WHY : As well as introducing self-defence methods, the intensive classes burn fat and train your reflexes.   WHERE : Visit urbanescrima.com to find out where the self-defence classes are held in London.   TRAIN LIKE AN ATHLETE   WHAT : High Energy Athletic Training \u2013 H.E.A.T. \u2013 is an hour-long workout class billed as 'Virgin Active's most intense yet'. It is split into three 20-minute sets: aerobic exercise, weights and 'explosivity'. The first set is designed to get the blood flowing, the second uses weights to build strength and the last wrings the final ounces of power out of the body with sprints and speed work.   WHY : These classes are based on 'periodisation', a system used by athletes to reach peak performance and push the body while limiting risk of injury, by dividing the training into manageable phases. The intensity increases throughout the class.   WHERE : Virgin Active clubs are due to launch H.E.A.T. classes this month.   PUT UP A FIGHT    WHAT : Boxing was listed as a firm favourite among the Victoria's Secret posse as part of their fitness regime last year, so it is no surprise that Angels Sara Sampaio and Maryna Linchuk (along with heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua) are among the founders of BXR London, a new boxing gym opening this month.   WHY : In 2010, US sports channel ESPN gathered a panel of experts including Olympic Committee sports scientists, academics and athletes to determine which sport was the toughest, and came to the conclusion that boxing was the one that required the most overall athleticism.   WHERE : Membership is \u00a31,500 per year. However, February will see the launch of Sweat By BXR, a \u00a330 pay-as-you-go option for non-members. bxrlondon.com   FEEL VIRTUOUS WITH VERTUE   WHAT : An elite gymnast and ballet dancer in her youth, Shona Vertue, has since trained as a yoga teacher and developed her own training 'method'. The Vertue Method is a 55-minute class that combines kettlebell weights, circuit training, yoga, gymnastics and meditation.   WHY : After warming up and activating the muscles, the programme uses resistance-band exercises and kettlebell weights, and finishes with yoga and meditation to stretch the muscles and lower the heart rate, which Shona says aids recovery.   WHERE : Shona's series of workout videos can be seen on shonavertue.com. Classes are due to be held in New Balance's studio in Central London in the next few weeks.",

An estimated 73million Americans from as far north as Maine and as far south as Mississippi are under winter weather storm warnings, according to  NBC .    Of the lower 48 states, 19 are now being affected by either winter storm warnings or advisories.   The snow storm, Helena, is gradually moving toward the mid-Atlantic and Northeast states, with warnings and advisories in effect along the coasts and up through New England, according to  The National Weather Service .     New York City is expected to see between three and five inches of snow today, while forecasters predict as much as eight inches in Long Island.    Authorities in Connecticut had to shut down Interstate 91 in both directions after a 30-car pileup clogged traffic, according to  NBC Connecticut .   Scroll down for video      Police said the crash near exit 21 involved at least 20 cars, three tractor trailers and a tanker. No serious injuries were reported.   The mayor of Middletown said that fuel tanks from at least two of the trucks ruptured, spilling diesel fuel onto the highway.   State workers were at the scene trying to clean up the spill, the mayor said.   NBC Connecticut  is updating a list of local institutions that have closed due to the weather.    Hundreds of flights were canceled, according to  NBC , more than 50 flights were canceled at New York JFK and Newark airports early Saturday. Delta canceled 175 flights, most of which were into and out of its hub in Atlanta.   Police investigated several fatal crashes as potentially storm-related, but some of the South's biggest cities \u2014 Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh \u2014 appeared to avoid the worst of the storm.    Authorities praised residents for learning the lessons of past storms that resulted in icy gridlock, where thousands of people were stranded along the interstates. But officials warned that bitter cold would keep roads treacherous well after the snow and sleet stopped.   'If I tell you anything it would be stay home,' North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. 'Do not go out and drive on the roads unless you absolutely have to.'   Cooper was supposed to have been sworn in Saturday at an outdoor ceremony attended by thousands.   He instead rushed through a 20-minute indoor oath-taking Friday.   'Consider yourselves the chosen few,' Cooper jokingly told family, friends and well-wishers able to attend his swearing-in Friday.   North Carolina cities Burlington, Greensboro and Roxboro received eight inches or more of snow, and several inches fell in southeast Virginia, where a blizzard warning was issued for the cities along the coast.   North Carolina reported more than 250 crashes, while Virginia had more than 100.    In Charlotte alone, 35 accidents were reported since 10pm on Friday, according to  NBC News .    Hundreds of crashes were reported in Tennessee starting Friday.    Some of these were fender benders involving school buses driving along roads that were covered by up to two inches of snow.    Power outages had grown to about 25,000 in North Carolina alone, according to a news release from the governor. Nearly half were in the Charlotte area and adjacent Union County, according to Duke Power.   In Cornelius, north of Charlotte, Matt Thomas said he used a ruler to measure nearly six inches of snow and sleet that had piled up on the back of his pickup truck. He planned to spend the weekend enjoying the snow and watching television. A plow passed through his neighborhood, but the road still looked slippery.   'The sleet started first, so there's definitely a layer of ice under the snow,' he said by phone. 'I'm staying home.'   The unpredictable storm left some areas with much different outcomes than neighboring counties. Unofficial totals from the National Weather Service showed that much of Raleigh and Charlotte had two inches or less of precipitation \u2014 much of it sleet \u2014 while areas to the north of both cities got several inches of snow.   In Atlanta and parts of Georgia, people who were expecting a couple of inches of snow instead woke up to a thin coat of ice. Still, it didn't stop children from sliding down slick grassy hills in what is a once- or twice-a-year icy occurrence.   Some took to social media to complain that they didn't have anything to sled in, prompting an apologetic Tweet from one well-known Raleigh weatherman.   'To all my detractors, more than 24 hours ago I began talking about how this snow event could go up in smoke. I try to be honest-all I can do,' WRAL-TV chief meteorologist Greg Fishel said early Saturday.   A blizzard warning for southeast Virginia accompanied forecasts of high winds and up to nine inches of snow there. The National Weather Service had already measured nearly six inches of snow at its post in Wakefield on Saturday.   Even with snow coating Virginia Beach roads, diners and staff made it to the popular breakfast spot Citrus.   'When there's bad weather, people come out,' manager Tara Junke said. 'I've worked in restaurants for 20 years in Hampton Roads and we've never shut down for snow.'   Chris Turner, 58, a health care analyst sitting at the counter with a mug of tea, said he drove seven miles to his usual breakfast spot, aided by four-wheel drive.   'It's fun to enjoy mother nature in all her glory,' he said. 'I'd rather be out. I can't stay at home.'             Raleigh-Durham International Airport said its staff worked through the night to clear runways.      It said most airlines had canceled flights through mid-morning.   Most flights have been canceled at Norfolk's airport because of the winter storm, the latest disruption to hit airports in the region.   The website for Norfolk International Airport shows that every arriving flight has been cancelled for Saturday, as well as most departing flights.   In North Carolina, Raleigh's airport said there were many cancellations and it expected very few flights to arrive or depart on Saturday.    The Charlotte airport said it would open with limited operations after de-icing 70 planes on Friday and plowing of the airfield.    It advised travelers to check their carrier for cancellations.    Atlanta's airport said that some flights have been canceled but that regular takeoffs and landings were resuming.   With southeast Virginia next in the storm's path, police in Newport News say roads in the city are 'extremely hazardous.'    The National Weather Service reports nearly six inches of snow at its Wakefield office.   The Virginia National Guard says about 200 members are staged at firehouses around southeast Virginia with Humvees and trucks to help police and firefighters.           Much of North Carolina is under a winter storm warning until 7pm Saturday and southeast Virginia was under a blizzard warning.   Meanwhile, ice and snow on some roads in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia made driving hazardous.   'Whenever snow comes people get really excited. I'm a little excited,' said Donovan Cheatham, who studies music at North Carolina Central University and plays in jazz bands.   He and roommate Collin Williams said if they get snowed in, they may miss a paying gig but will jam anyway - Collins on alto saxophone and Cheatham on drums.   'Practice. We'll get a lot of practice in,' Williams said.   Lauren Rathbone, manager of Public Hardware in Durham, North Carolina, said the store sold out of more than 100 sleds Friday, along with bags and bags of ice melt to treat driveways and walks.       Some took to sledding in snow-coated northern Atlanta suburbs and in Tennessee.   Meanwhile California is preparing for heavy rains not seen in a decade. Officials said up to 12 inches of rain is expected in the lower-lying areas of the state, according to  The Los Angeles Times .   The rain is in addition to the heavy snowfall - up to 6 feet in some areas - that has accumulated in the regions above 8,500 feet that comprise the Sierra Nevada mountain range.   Some rain showers were reported in the San Francisco area, but that's just the beginning of what's expected this weekend.   'We're expecting heavy, heavy rain. It starts out as snow then turns to rain then turns to snow again,' Hammitt said. 'We're concerned about the melt increasing waterways and all the lakes.'   'People are definitely in a state of panic right now,' said El Dorado County sheriff's Sgt. Todd Hammitt.    'We're getting a lot of calls asking if we're going to be able to deal with everything. It's the general pandemonium of not knowing what's coming.'    The combination of rain and melting snow could create the conditions for some of the worst flooding in California in at least 20 years, according to  AccuWeather .    'There is the potential for excessive rain, combined with melting snow to trigger the worst flooding in northern California since 1997 and perhaps 1986,' an executive with AccuWeather Enterprise Solutions, Mike Smith, said.   An 'atmospheric river' weather system dumped rain and snow in California on Thursday, and forecasters said another, stronger, plume of moisture from the Pacific Ocean would slam the state during the weekend.   An atmospheric river is a long and narrow region of the atmosphere that horizontally transports moisture out of the tropics, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.    An atmospheric river that brings moisture to the West Coast from near Hawaii is sometimes called a 'Pineapple Express.'   The system prompted heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada, where the Mammoth Mountain ski resort reported accumulations ranging from 44 inches to 7 feet in 1\u00bd days, with more falling.   The snowfall closed mountain routes or forced chain and snow tire requirements.    The heavy winds and snowfall could potentially trigger avalanches in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.",

   "7. content": "Another day. And the news marches on.   Runs forward almost, into the next drama. A shooting in a Fort Lauderdale airport. Carrie Fisher's ashes carried in a giant Prozac-shaped jar. Trump's 12 days from moving into the White House.   We turn the pages quickly on the stories of life, anxious not to get left behind.   But the real people, people whose lives only fascinated us for an instant, whose stories grabbed us for a moment, good and bad - they are still living their story, their nightmare.   The party-goers shot in a club in Istanbul, patched up but shattered.    The families of the Chapecoence football team whose bodies were flung across the hillside in the night, still utterly lost.    Scroll down for video     The mothers of children mowed down by a truck when they were shopping amidst the twinkling lights of a Christmas market.    All left wondering if there\u2019s any point in getting out of bed tomorrow. To what purpose? To what end?   And the parents of the special needs teen who was kidnapped and tortured by four black kids on Facebook live in Chicago.   Mocked for his mental capacity. Scalp cut repeatedly. Tied up. Forced to drink toilet water by four black kids who made him kiss the floor and shout 'f*** white people' and 'f*** Trump\u2019.   I imagine these parents today, shocked into silence. Struck mute by the horror that everything they thought they knew last week is no longer true.   That they were wrong to trust. Wrong to believe there is good in everyone. Wrong to think everything would be ok. It wasn't.   Wondering if they will ever be able to talk about anything else, ever again.   Predictably, we all shouted for a while.   Some of us were sickened. And shouted about that. Some blamed Black Lives Matter. And stuck a hashtag on that. Liberals retaliated, calling a hashtag racist. And wrote an article blaming whites.   I tore my own hair out watching CNN and the BBC try to excuse it all away.    Diving on in with my say. Imagining just how this would have played out if the victim were black and it was the mugshots of four white kids we were looking at.   But today, as always, the news has rushed on.   In the end, the family has been left to drag their son's bloodied body through their door into the safety of home.    To try and see what is left of him. Which bits of the son they raised have been returned.   But I can't get away from it. I keep coming back to it. I can't get the smell of the thing off me.   The stench of a life half-destroyed, a family that has lost any reason to live.   I am pulled backwards. We all are. We regressed. To a time where the world is a jungle. Dogs eat dog. Every man stands for himself.   Survival of the fittest, where to fit you need to be more evil than the man you think is your friend.   The victim thought he was meeting his friends for a McDonald's.   Imagine for one moment being the mother of the kidnapped boy. Having spent your life trying to care for your son.    Looking at the little baby next to you in his cot, knowing you would do anything to keep him safe.   A lifetime making sure his gloves were in his pockets and he ate something hot for dinner.    Of asking if he needed the bathroom before you left the house, providing a reassuring word to fix this, a big cuddle to soothe that. Making sure he washed his hands before tea and had a clean shirt for school.   A whole life centered around making sure your most precious thing would be safe. Always walking roadside beside him, a silent acknowledgement that you\u2019ll always be ready to take the hit if it will keep your precious child safe.   Knowing you can only keep this up for so long.   And so it turned out for the boy's mum. Only for so long. Only 18 years.   If it were my son, I would still be lying where they dragged the ruins of my child back through the front door. Still be clasped tight around him. Refusing to ever let go again.   Not caring about the wet, the smell, the filth they had put on him. Caring only for the warm thing beneath.   Screaming at everyone to get out. To get away. Wild like an animal. Willing to kill anything that came near my young. Spitting. Scratching. Kicking out.   And I'd hate. All of you.   You with too much to say. Al Sharpton with your $1,000 donation to make this not about blacks.    People like me, bleating on about the way this would have been if the victim were black. Don Lemon on TV pretending those monsters are not evil.    You, grandma, saying his tormentor is a good girl really.   I'd hate you all. Shut you all out. Close down the world. Lock all the doors and barricade myself in his bedroom, clutched to my child like a drowning woman.   Just me and my son. Safe in our nest. Away from you lot circling like vultures for scraps. Making this about you. Making this about color or a cause.   Look, I'd shout from the window, manic in my hatred. Look what you did. Look what you all did.   All of you - you pathetic people, you self-righteous liberals, you useless parents, you biased b*stards, you media pariahs, you prying fools - look what you did.   So now you are pray for me? Expecting me to believe there is a god. How dare you?   You are donating cash? What would you like me to spend it on? Money may assuage your guilt, shield you from your revulsion. But what dollar bill will make mend my son's head or heart.   Get away, the lot of you.   You broke my son.   You broke my son.",

   "7. content": "Congressional Republicans\u2019 years-long mission to dismantle ObamaCare is becoming more of an uphill battle, amid a growing concern among some GOP senators about voting to repeal the health care law without a replacement. \n The most recent is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who late Friday tweeted that incoming President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, agrees with his approach to simultaneously repeal and replace the 2010 law. \n \"I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it,\" Paul tweeted. \"The time to act is now.\" \n Earlier in the day, GOP Sens. Bob Corker, Tennessee, and Ron Johnson, Wisconsin, expressed similar thoughts. \n Corker said Republicans might find themselves in a \"box canyon\" if they just incrementally replace parts of the law. \n He worries about congressional Republicans having to take an unpopular vote to increase taxes if, for example, they repeal the part of ObgamaCare that increased taxes on higher wage-earners but temporarily continue subsidies in the law that help lower-income Americans buy coverage. \n Johnson said: \u201cI would start bringing up those elements that start repairing the damage and I would start taking votes on those right now.\u201d \n President Obama\u2019 signature law was created to provide universal health coverage to Americans, in an effort to reduce overall health care costs by curtailing emergency room visits for routine care and other uninsured medical expenses. \n However, under-enrollment, particularly among young and healthy participants, along with doctors and insurance companies dropping out, has resulted in rising premium costs. \n Trump and other Washington Republicans have campaigned almost endlessly on the promise to dismantle ObamaCare. But ending it without an alternative for the roughly 20 million now enrolled could result in a political train wreck.   \n Senate Republicans on Tuesday, the first day of the 115th Congress, took the first legislative steps to repeal the law. \n However, they made clear in the time between Trump\u2019s November win and their return that a full replacement might take years, considering they had no alternative plan. The situation puts them under tremendous pressure to fulfill \"Day One\" promises to voters to end ObamaCare.  \n The Trump transition team did not respond Saturday to a request from FoxNews.com to verify Paul\u2019s claim about Trump\u2019s support. \n Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also called this week for a simultaneous effort to erase the health care law and rewrite it. \n \"I don't think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we're going to get an answer two years from now,\" he said Thursday on MSNBC. \n \"We haven't coalesced around a solution for six years, in part because it is so complicated,\u201d he also said. \u201cKicking the can down the road for a year or two years isn't going to make it any easier to solve.\" \n With Trump as president and fellow Republicans controlling Congress, the GOP indeed finally has an opportunity to repeal the law. \n But nothing about revamping the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system will come easy, with congressional Democrats vowing the stop Republicans at essentially every step.   \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said if Republicans void Obama's bill, Democrats won't help them pass alternative legislation. \n Republicans probably will need just a simple Senate majority to approve their repeal bill, but for procedural reasons, later replacement legislation likely will need 60 votes. \n Republicans now hold a 52-48 edge in the Senate. That means a need for at least eight Democratic votes, though there will be pressure on 10 Democrats facing re-election next year from states Trump won in November. \n \"I take Minority Leader Schumer at his word that if we do this we're not going to get any Democratic support. In order to actually pass a replacement, we need Democratic support,\" Johnson said. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

For I have just completed a month-long experiment of \u2018microdosing\u2019 not with vitamins or even prescription medicine, but with the psychedelic drug LSD.   And I am not alone.   This week sees the publication of a new book, A Really Good Day, by a former lawyer and mother-of-four called Ayelet Waldman, who explains how taking tiny amounts of the drug transformed her life after a long-term struggle with depression and serious mood swings that affected her marriage and her ability as a parent.   The book is set to create quite a stir. Indeed, microdosing is already a good deal more common than you might think.    There is a growing body of literature about its benefits and I certainly found plenty of people ready to advise me.   Taking a Class A drug is, of course, illegal, which is why this article must be written under a pseudonym, and I would caution against self-medication, particularly when the source of drugs is so often unclear.   So why, you might ask, would I bother? I lead a perfectly normal life as an academic. I\u2019m very careful about what I eat and drink, and what little free time I have is spent on wholesome pursuits such as sewing and walking the dog.   Foolish as drug-taking might seem, though \u2013 and it is certainly illegal \u2013 I\u2019ve done it for good reasons. I am midway through an early menopause and it is imperative that I look after myself in order to moderate my moods, both for my sake and for those around me.    And I can confidently say that the tiny doses of LSD improved my state of mind, my ability to focus, and my general health without any of the weird and wonderful visual effects that people might imagine.   I did my research. For a start, I learned that psychedelics such as LSD are much less toxic than other drugs, including alcohol and antidepressants. They won\u2019t give you a hangover, cancer, or liver disease, and they are not addictive.    The low cost of producing them means there is no logical reason for dealers to substitute it with something else, so purity and contamination are not an issue.   A study recently published in medical journal The Lancet reported markedly reduced symptoms in patients with severe depression and anxiety after treatment with psychedelics \u2013 an improvement that was sustained three months after receiving only two doses, one week apart.    So, with this in mind, I procured a small \u2018tab\u2019 of LSD from an acquaintance (no charge), and with my dressmaking scissors I cut it into ten tiny pieces. I put one on my tongue, placed the others in a square of foil in the freezer, and headed out to my yoga class.   That first day, I returned feeling energised and happy and \u2013 out of habit \u2013 I made myself a coffee before sitting down at my desk.   That, it turned out, was not the best idea and I was uncomfortably jittery for a couple of hours.   Yet once the caffeine had worn off, I had the \u2018really good day\u2019 I\u2019d read about. I organised my notes, drafted a conference proposal, sent some emails I\u2019d been putting off and constructed a fresh to-do list.    In the evening I took the dog for a walk and called in to see a friend. It turned out I was much more affectionate towards her than normal. I decided to press ahead with my programme \u2013 and the benefits duly followed.   As the days went by, I found myself responding more positively to the stupid things we all do. When I was rushing to fix my lunch and knocked a large bag of chilli flakes everywhere I would have normally have been angry with myself, but now I just laughed.   I would urge women to avoid any kind of experimentation with drugs. Never mind the fact that LSD is illegal, so much of this account makes no medical sense.   Phrases such as allowing the brain to \u2018rebalance chemically\u2019 (a spurious non-medical notion) should alert people to the idea that this experiment has been taken without the due diligence and safety provided by medical trials and genuine medical experience.   When drugs come to market for prescription, they are tested on vast numbers of patients: for example, trials on conventional HRT were done on 1 million women.   To me, this is an account from a woman who wanted something to happen from the treatment she tried, and felt a placebo effect.   I became more interested in other people, which made socialising a lot more enjoyable. I found I could happily play with my niece and nephews for hours. My sister-in-law\u2019s relief was palpable.   The microdosing method I decided to follow dictates that you microdose only every third day. The rest days re-acquaint the brain with \u2018business as usual\u2019 and allow it to rebalance chemically. While research continues into exactly how LSD acts on the brain, we know that it binds to serotonin receptors, and that this may help to explain the mood-stabilising effects that have been reported in microdosing.   And contrary to its reputation as a 1970s drug for drop-outs, its renewed popularity initially took off among some of the most successful people on the planet \u2013 Silicon Valley entrepreneurs seeking ways to feel more productive and less stressed. It seems the effects were so good, they couldn\u2019t keep it to themselves.   One of the most commonly reported effects of microdosing is that people find themselves making healthier choices, such as exercising, eating better and drinking more water. This was certainly the case with me.   I rediscovered an enthusiasm for leaving the office at lunchtime and going for a run along the river. It sounds strange, but I feel more affectionate towards my body and my mind. I no longer feel like we\u2019re fighting one another.   I\u2019m aware that drugs can ruin lives and I wouldn\u2019t want others to copy my example.   But I\u2019ve not been afraid to tell people about the experiment, including my boss at work, and I hope that one day this sort of treatment could be available as properly regulated medicine.   My boss tells me that I\u2019ve changed, that I seem happier and more confident. It certainly feels that way.\u2019",

Atlanta Hammond, from Braintree, Essex, says she was subjected to daily physical abuse, banned from socialising and forced to quit her job by her ex-boyfriend.   And when the mother-of-one plucked up the courage to leave him, he threatened to publish a video of himself raping her while she slept and post it online.    The 21-year-old, who has a two-year-old son, says her former partner exerted control over her from the time they met in 2013, when she was just 18.   She said Halil Cetinkayali, 30, made her 'feel like a princess' - before things quickly turned sour.   Halil, who Atlanta described as a staunch Muslim, made her quit  her job as a carer 'out of respect for his faith'.   And after Googling friends' names on the internet one day, she found he was using an alias and was wanted by police.   However, when she confronted him, he turned violent, grabbing her throat and said he would post the footage of the two of them online.   The pair stayed together, with Halil abusing her   every day.   She told  The Sun : ' I didn\u2019t have to do anything to get hit. Say the wrong thing, answer back, talk to the wrong person.    'He\u2019d make me sit on the phone to him all night if I was at a friend\u2019s house.   'I wasn\u2019t allowed to see any male friends. In fact, eventually, he banned me seeing anyone but my mum \u2013 and for those times he\u2019d buy me concealer.'   The abuse finally became too much for Atlanta one night when she attempted to escape Halil's clutches as he slept and go to her mother's house.   However Halil caught Atlanta as she was about to get into a cab outside their home, viciously assaulting her and stabbing her in the hip as a result.    It was after this final attack that a brave Atlanta plucked up the courage to tell the police of the abuse, and he was arrested for wounding with intent.   But such was the power he had over his victim that Halil was able to convince Atlanta to retract her statement and he was released with an electronic tag in July 2014.     It was at this point that Halil showed her the video he had taken off himself raping Atlanta while she slept.     It was this threat that proved the final straw for the mother of one, who sent a final text to Halil with pictures of the cuts and bruises she has suffered at his hands.   Incredibly, Halil would himself post the images onto Facebook, along with the caption ' This is the girl I beat up and cheated on for two years'.   Atlanta broke off all contact with Halil afterwards, and wouldn't see him again until she returned to her home one day to find him lying on her bed.   He chased her into the street and viciously attacked her in broad daylight, leading neighbours to call for the police.   It was after his arrest that Atlanta finally told police officers the whole story of her physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her partner.    Halil was sentenced to 19 years and eight months in prison in April.",

The four were also charged with two hate crimes - one because the young man was disabled and one because of race.   The teen, who is white, suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder.    He attended a special needs school in Aurora, Illinois with one of the accused, Jordan Hill.   Hill was also charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. He, Cooper and Brittany Covington face additional charges of residential burglary, according to Cook County State Attorney's Office.   Attorneys for the suspects tried to argue for their bail by telling the judge about their background and family life.   Public defenders say 24-year-old suspect Covington, of Chicago, is the mother of two children, ages 11 months and two years old.   They said her sister, Brittany Covington, of Chicago, attends college and is involved with her church.   Tanishia Covington is the only accused with a prior adult criminal record, according to reports.   In 2005, she was convicted of shoplifting, and she pleaded guilty in April of 2016 for failing to appear at her court date on a criminal trespass to a vehicle charge.   Her grandmother told the AP on Friday: \u2018I'm so upset, my head is about to bust open.   \u2018I don't know if someone influenced her. ... She had her ups and down. [She] was a good person. I'm so confused.\u2019   The attorneys say Hill, of suburban Carpentersville, works for a staffing company assembling furniture and attends church with his grandmother.   They say the fourth suspect Cooper, of Chicago, cares for his twin brother who uses a wheelchair and is a high school junior.    The victim\u2019s aunt told DailyMail.com on Friday that he was unable to speak about the attack \u2013 other than to repeatedly ask why a friend he idolized had done this to him.   Janet Grant said her nephew would be mentally scarred by the prolonged ordeal where he was bound, beaten, cut, burned and forced to drink from a toilet.   Grant said: '[The victim] just keeps saying, 'Why, why? Jordan was my friend. He's been my friend for a couple of years.'   She continued: 'They went to school together, they both had problems. He adores Jordan. I don't know Jordan but [the victim] really liked him. It's one thing if they didn't know each other but [the victim] idolized him.'   The four friends arrested in the incident allegedly expressed no remorse for the torture.   Grant, who is the sister of the victim's father said the family were 'terrible' since the teenager's ordeal.   'He's got enough problems already. They put cigarette butts out on his head, cut a hole in his scalp. Once they took him to Chicago, he had no meds for four days. He couldn't even fight back.   'Physically he'll heal but mentally\u2026he'll always be looking over his shoulder. Probably won't trust anybody. '   Grant said that she was unsure if any family members would attend the first court appearance of the four accused on Friday.   'I don't even know if my brother's going \u2013 everyone is having a hard time dealing with it,' she said.   The family does not know the connection Hill had to the other three accused. His aunt said the only thing she would ask them is 'why \u2013 just why?'   His cousin, Kyle Pudowski, 21, told DailyMail.com: 'I don't know what made people do that. It's crazy.'   Mrs Grant added: 'Or even watch people do that. How could a woman watch that? They thought it was going to make them popular \u2013 putting cigarette butts out on a kid with schizophrenia and ADHD.'   Kyle Pudowski said he hoped that the perpetrators would receive lengthy prison sentences for that they had done.   The aunt added: 'It's not even about the punishment \u2013 just why?   Grant said the family had been deeply touched by the outpouring of support from the local community and beyond. A GoFundMe account set up with a goal of raising $10,000 has surpassed $82,000.   'It's wonderful,' she said. 'It's sad it takes something like this.'   Grant said that she had spent a lot of time with the victim and that she and her brother babysat each other's children when they were growing up.   She said: '[He's] a good boy. He would give you the shirt off his back.   'His mom didn't like him hanging out but [he] would say, \"that's my friend, that's my friend.\" He looked up to Jordan.   '[He] thought he was cool. I think he was one of the popular ones at school.'   The family made a brief statement to local TV stations on Thursday night.   David Boyd, the victim's brother-in-law, said: 'He's doing well as well as he could be at this time. We are so grateful for all the prayers and efforts that led to the safe return of our brother.   'This should never happen.'   Grant said that the victim's father was too devastated to speak at the brief news conference.   Streamwood Police Department said in a statement that his parents reported him missing on January 2.   They had last heard from him on New Year's Eve after dropping him off at a McDonald's restaurant in Streamwood, close to their home.   As police investigated the disappearance, the parents received text messages from the captors.   Police then found a disturbing video showing the victim being tortured.   The video lasts for 30 minutes but investigators believe that the vulnerable victim's ordeal went on for six hours.   It was initially posted by Brittany Covington but has since been deleted.   In another video that surfaced on Wednesday night, the torturers force the victim to drink water from a toilet.   The unidentified victim was able to make a break for it when the downstairs neighbors reported the noise to police.   The victim has been returned to his parents.   Chicago authorities revealed more about the disturbing incident on Thursday.   The victim's parents dropped him off at a McDonald's on Saturday so that he could spend the night at Hill's home. '[He] told [his mother] that he was meeting a friend there but never said who,' according to a missing person's report.   '[His mother] believes that the friend [the victim] was meeting is Jordan.'   The parents became worried on Monday after only having sporadic text messages from their son and then his phone being turned off.   Police considered the teenager 'a missing endangered person due to his mental health history and not currently taking his medication.'   His mother thought he may be with another friend, Derek, in the area but she didn't know his last name or if it is his real name because he did 'not like telling his parents who he is with,' the police report stated.   On Saturday night, Hill had allegedly picked the victim up in a stolen van. For the first two days, the two visited friends and the victim reportedly slept in the van at night.   On Tuesday, the pair visited the West Chicago residence of the Covington sisters where Cooper was also present.   A few hours after they arrived at the house, Hill and the victim got into a play fight that then escalated to a prolonged torture.   Police said the young man made so much noise as he was being tortured that the downstairs neighbors eventually called police to report the noise.   The group became angered with the downstairs neighbors, and three of them went downstairs to kick the neighbor's door in. It was at this moment that the victim was able to make a break for it.   Outside of the residence, a police officer found the victim 'bloodied and bruised', wearing a tank top and shorts in the dead of winter.   The victim was treated in hospital and has been returned to his parents.   On Thursday, President Obama said he believed the 'despicable' actions seen in the video were examples of long-existing hatred, and not a sign of U.S. race relations getting worse.   Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said: 'The actions in that video are reprehensible. That along with racism have absolutely no place in the city of Chicago or anywhere else for that matter, against anyone regardless of their race, gender, state of mental health or any other identifying factor.\u2019",

Scroll down for video     The couple were due to head out on the cruise a day after they arrived at Fort Lauderdale.    Mr Oehme's sister, Elizabeth Oehme-Miller, 52, told  The Associated Press  on Saturday the situation 'hasn't hit' her yet and she is still in disbelief.    She said the couple were frequent travelers and were 'happy to be going on another trip.'   Mrs Oehme is currently in hospital being treated for her gunshot wounds.       Witness Mark Lea, told  WOWT 6  he had raced back inside the airport to help victims and found Mrs Oehme down and lying in 'a pool of blood'.   Lea is also from Council Bluffs, but said he did not know Mr and Mrs Oehme.   Olga Woltering, was a British native from Marietta, Georgia who was also scheduled to leave on a cruise from Florida on Saturday with her husband Ralph to celebrate his 90th birthday.   The  Catholic Church of Transfiguration released a statement on their website saying Woltering was 'active in many ministries' and whose family had been members of the church since 1978.   Fellow church members said the devout Catholic woman was believed to be in her 80s.    'Olga was so charming, calling everybody \"Lovey\" or \"Love\" in her unmistakable British accent,' the statement  said.    A parishioner told AP Olga and Ralph were 'the life of the party.'         Members of the Transfiguration Catholic Church where the couple attended posted their condolences on Facebook on Friday night.   Mrs Woltering was described as a 'wonderful wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother and friend'.    Terry Andres was on vacation with his wife of 40 years when he was killed. His wife was able to escape from the terrifying ordeal unharmed.   Mr Andres daughter confirmed that the 62-year-old was among those to have died at the airport,  WAVY-TV  reports.   Mr Andres had worked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and had volunteered with the local fire department in Virginia Beach.   His family said he was well known and loved by the community. He was due to celebrate his 63rd birthday soon, his daughter said.       Two others were shot dead and eight were wounded when the gunman opened fire in the baggage claim area.   Authorities have not released the name's of any of the victims.   The shooter, Santiago, was taken into custody immediately after the incident.   Police are investigating whether he was mentally disturbed or had links to any extremist groups including the Islamic State.   Authorities said Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage in November last year claiming the government was trying to control his mind and he was being forced to watch videos for ISIS, CBS reports. After that incident, Santiago started getting treatment for his mental health issues.",

Crowley plagiarized vast sections of her books in more than 50 instances, a  CNN KFile  report has found.   Trump's transition team has dismissed the report as a 'politically motivated attack'.   The conservative author published 'What The (Bleep) Just Happened', a critique of Barack Obama's first presidency, in 2012.    The book, according to Monday's report, contains numerous sections lifted from outlets such as The New York Times, The Associated Press and Investopedia, without a bibliography or notes.     Crowley, set to serve as director of strategic communications for the National Security Council, appears to have taken passages from several columnists, news stories and even Wikipedia articles.    Trump's transition team has dismissed the latest accusations against Crowley.    'Monica's exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this country around is exactly why she will be serving in the Administration,' a transition spokesperson told CNN in a statement.   'HarperCollins\u2014one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world\u2014published her book which has become a national best-seller. Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country.'   One of the passages outlined in Saturday's report is what Crowley presented as a list of 'porkstatic spending items' from the 2009 stimulus package. But most of the items actually came from a podiatrist's 2004 website, and many came from a conservative list with some items dating back to the 1990s, CNN wrote.   Crowley also seems to have taken a large section from Investopedia, explaining Keynesian economics.   Eleven passages from the 2012 book also look identical to articles published in the National Review by Andrew C McCarthy, a friend of Crowley's.   Crowley was accused of plagiarism in 1999, after one of her Wall Street Journal columns looked similar to a 1988 story in Commentary magazine.    'Had we known of the parallels, we would not have published the article,' a Wall Street Journal editor's note read according to  Slate .   Crowley denied the accusation, telling the  New York Times  at the time: 'I did not, nor would I ever, use material from a source without citing it.'      The DailyMail.com has reached out to Trump's transition team for further comment.    Crowley's book       'A critical part of Keynesian theory is the multiplier effect, first introduced by British economist and Keynes prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Richard Kahn in the 1930s. It essentially argued that when the government injected spending into the economy, it created cycles of spending that increased employment and prosperity regardless of the form of the spending.   Here's how the multiplier is supposed to work: a $100 million government infrastructure project might cost $50 million in labor.   The workers then take that $50 million and, minus the average saving rate, spend it on various goods and services. Those businesses then use that money to hire more people to make more products, leading to another round of spending. This idea was central to the New Deal and the growth of the Left's redistributionist state. The great free market economist and Nobel Laureate in Economics Milton [...]'         Investopedia       'The Keynesian multiplier was introduced by Richard Kahn in the 1930s. It showed that any government spending brought about cycles of spending that increased employment and prosperity regardless of the form of the spending.   For example, a $100 million government project, whether to build a dam or dig and refill a giant hole, might pay $50 million in pure labor costs.   The workers then take that $50 million and, minus the average saving rate, spend it at various businesses. These businesses now have more money to hire more people to make more products, leading to another round of spending. This idea was at the core of the New Deal and the growth of the welfare state.'        Crowley's book       'At that point, they became like the woman in a famous story about Winston Churchill. At a dinner party one night, a drunk Churchill asked an attractive lady whether she would sleep with him for a million pounds. \"Maybe,\" she said coyly. Churchill then said, \"Would you sleep with me for one pound?\"   \"Of course not!\" the woman replied indignantly. \"What kind of woman do you think I am?\"   \"Madam, we've already established what kind of woman you are,\" said Churchill. \"Now we're just negotiating the price.\" '     Blogspot       'There is a great story about Winston Churchill. At a dinner party one night, a drunk Churchill asked an attractive woman whether she would sleep with him for a million pounds. \"Maybe,\" the woman said coyly. \"Would you sleep with me for one pound?\" Churchill then asked.   \"Of course not, what kind of woman do you think I am?\" the woman responded indignantly.   \"Madam, we've already established what kind of woman you are,\" said Churchill, \"now we're just negotiating the price.\" '        Crowley's book   'They claim that the Health and Human Services secretary is authorized to issue temporary waivers to companies or insurers, freeing them from rules mandating minimum standards of health coverage. Other waivers, which Team Obama euphemistically calls 'adjustments,' let states ask the HHS secretary to free up requirements that insurers spend a certain percentage of premiums on medical care. And a third waiver, available in 2017, will allow states to effect their own health reforms, but only if they are consistent with Obama-Care's regulations and objectives. Within moments of the bill's passage, unions and companies began lining up to take advantage of the waiver \"outs.\" '       Politico   'The law authorizes the HHS secretary to issue waivers to companies or insurers freeing them from rules requiring minimum standards of health coverage. Other waivers, which the administration calls \"adjustments,\" allow states to ask the administration to loosen requirements that insurance companies spend a certain percentage of premiums on medical care. A third waiver will be available in 2017 that will allow states to implement their own health reforms, but only if they achieve the same basic goals as the original law \u2014 like covering as many people and making the insurance as generous and affordable as it would be under the law.'

Villanueva is also accused of stabbing her father-in-law, Eustorgio Arellano-Uresti, who tried to stop the attack.   Mr Arellano-Uresti says that at 11am January 5 he went to go make lunch at the home in Kyle, a town located 25 minutes from Austin.   According to  KXAN , he saw Villanueva take a knife to her back bedroom then he heard Giovanna crying out in pain.       Mr Arellano-Uresti tried to grab the weapon from Villanueva and she attacked him, stabbing him in the forehead and back.   Witnesses then saw Mr Arellano-Uresti leave the home and Villanueva run after him with a shotgun that was not loaded.   Police and the SWAT team were called to the scene and found Villanueva washing off in the shower. Giovanna was dead in a bedroom according to  Spectrum News.   Neighbors were shocked that such a horror could happen in the quiet Green Pastures subdivision.   Toxicology reports are still out, but Villanueva's friends said she suffered from drug addiction. They were also in shock that the mother could commit such a crime.   Arellano-Uresti alleged his daughter-in-law used drugs, alcohol and marijuana according to the affidavit. Her sister told officers in 2015 she went to a nearby rehab center for  substance abuse.   Villanueva's friend Sabrine Sifuentez told the station: 'She went to a rehab. She did a 90-day program and she came out good. She was doing good. She had a job.   'She tried to get help. I don't know if she just relapsed, or I really can't say what happened.'   On a live Facebook broadcast by KXAN, Sheriff Gary Cutler said: 'This is one of the worst cases I've ever seen.'     'The suspect has had minor issues with law enforcement in the past, nothing major.'    She is also charged with second-degree felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.    In one of the 'About Me' sections on one of her Facebook profiles she says: 'The most important things to me in life is family and succeeding in life but especially my daughter Giovanna La'Rae. I'd do anything in the world for this chick.'   Villanueva is being held on a $1.1 million bond at the Hays County Jail. Of the total $800,000 is for capital murder and $300,000 is for aggravated assault.",

The Army vet was getting psychological treatment, according to his brother, who said he didn't know precisely what the captured man was getting treated for. His family also said Santiago had been acting strangely after returning from Iraq.   FBI investigators have not ruled out terrorism as a reason for the attack, a special agent at the bureau's office in Miami said Saturday. They were set to pursue 'every angle' to try to determine the motive behind the deadly attack. The bureau believes Santiago came to Fort Lauderdale to carry out the horrific attack but chose it without any specific reason. Investigators haven't identified any triggers so far. Santiago is expected to appear in federal court Monday.     Scroll down for video    It took deputies 70 to 80 seconds to come into contact with the suspect, authorities said Saturday morning during a news conference. FBI investigators have identified all five victims in the attack but have yet to confirm their identities. Early reports said eight people were injured in the shooting. That number was revised to six on Saturday morning. Three were in good condition while three others were in the ICU.   Santiago flew into the airport from Anchorage, Alaska (with a layover in Minneapolis-St Paul) on Delta flight 2182 with a firearm as his only piece of checked luggage, in accordance with TSA regulations, authorities believe. The 26-year-old, who was dressed in a Star Wars T-shirt, claimed his bag, went to the bathroom to load his handgun and then started shooting people dead, according to the county commissioner.   Witnesses said the gunman sprayed bullets around then lay down on the floor spread-eagled, awaiting arrest. They described the gunman as a 5'7'' male wearing a blue T-shirt.   Investigators said on Saturday morning they hadn't identified an altercation on the flight or at baggage claim that could have led to the shooting. They interviewed 175 witnesses during their probe.   The suspect came to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport 'specifically to carry out this horrific attack', FBI Special Agent In Charge George Piro said Saturday morning at a news conference.   'We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack,' he added. An early investigation revealed no particular reason that could have caused the suspect to pick the airport.   Terry Andres, of Virginia, and Olga Woltering, of Georgia, were among those who were killed. Andres, a 62-year-old grandfather, was at the airport with his wife to go on a vacation, while Woltering was scheduled to leave on a cruise from Florida on Saturday with her husband Ralph to celebrate his 90th birthday.   Michael Oehme, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, was identified Saturday as one of the five victims, according to local reports. Oehme was about to go on a cruise with his wife, Kari Oehme. She was shot in the shoulder but is expected to survive.      Nearly 40 were hurt during the evacuation, CNN  reported. Some of them came out with broken bones. Governor Rick Scott visited the airport Saturday morning after meeting with many survivors, some of whom were 'fighting for their lives'.   'It was an absolutely horrific day,' Scott told  USA Today  about the shooting. 'The person responsible for this act will be brought to justice to the furthest extent of the law.'    The airport reopened Saturday morning after a 16-hour shutdown, which included a mass evacuation with numerous passengers taking cover. Terminal 2, where the shooting occurred, remained an active crime scene. Airport officials were going through more than 20,000 bags and personal items left during the evacuation. Security has been increased and will be re-evaluated in the future, Sheriff Scott Israel said.   Governor Scott meanwhile has expressed his hope that visitors will return to Florida in the future. 'We love our tourists and we want them to keep coming back,' Scott said Saturday morning at the airport, according to the  Miami Herald . 'The number one priority for our state is safety.'     Investigators questioned Santiago at length after the shooting and as of Saturday morning hadn't ruled out terrorism as a possible motive. They were reviewing the captured man's recent movements. Authorities believe he acted alone.   'We will be pursuing every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack,' special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in Miami George Piro told The Associated Press.      Santiago had gone AWOL several times while serving in the Alaska National Guard, the Pentagon said. He had served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and in the Alaska National Guard, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011.   The private first class and combat engineer received half a dozen medals before getting a general discharge for unsatisfactory performance in August last year.   Santiago had also been investigated as part of a child porn probe in 2011 or 2012, law enforcement told  CBS News . Authorities seized three weapons and a computer but didn't file any charges, the network reported.    The 26-year-old had a history of mental health issues, according to his relatives - some of which  followed his military service in Iraq several years ago.   A 62-year-old man and a great grandmother were among the victims of the deadly Ft. Lauderdale airport shooting in Florida.   Terry Andres, of Virginia, and Olga Woltering, of Georgia, were among the five shot dead by 26-year-old gunman Esteban Santiago as passengers collected their baggage in the terminal on Friday.   Andres was on vacation with his wife when he was killed.        Olga Woltering, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, was scheduled to leave on a cruise from Florida on Saturday with her husband Ralph to celebrate his 90th birthday.   Authorities said Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage in November last year claiming the government was trying to control his mind and he was being forced to watch ISIS videos, CBS reported.   Investigators did a background check and found no connection between Santiago and terror groups, USA Today    wrote. They turned over the suspect to local authorities for a medical referral.    After that incident, Santiago started getting treatment for his mental health issues, sources said.   He was previously pictured giving a one-fingered salute, which is commonly used by Islamic State jihadists often before they embark on a suicide bombing.   Santiago was also contacted by the FBI after an employer back in Alaska raised concerns about certain things he had said, according to ABC News.      His aunt Maria Ruiz told  NorthJersey.com  that Santiago had returned from Iraq  acting strangely but had seemed happy after the  birth of his child in September last year.    But she said something happened to him about a month ago and he was hospitalized for two weeks. She did not have details of his condition.     'Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind. He said he saw things,' she said.   Santiago's brother Bryan Santiago said he could have suffered a 'flashback' from his time in Iraq, despite never being diagnosed with PTSD,  NBC  reports.       The man suspected to be behind the deadly shooting at Florida's Ft Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport is an Iraq war veteran who had recently become a father and was suffering mental health issues, according to his family.   Authorities believe Esteban Santiago, 26, left five people dead and six wounded when he opened fire in the airport's baggage claim terminal on Friday.   His family have said Santiago was struggling with psychiatric problems in the lead up to the shooting and had recently been hospitalized for treatment in Anchorage, Alaska.   Santiago had also been charged with domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend in January 2016,  The Daily Beast  reports.   He allegedly verbally abused her in their apartment in Anchorage, Alaska while she was locked in the bathroom. Santiago is accused of then breaking down the door and hitting the woman in the head and strangling her.   Santiago was arrested days later after fleeing the scene but was released on the condition he stayed away from the victim. He was charged with violating the conditions in February 2016 after police found him at his girlfriend's home. The assault case was resolved in March.   His brother Bryan Santiago, who lives in Puerto Rico, said his family got a call in recent months from Santiago's girlfriend alerting them to his health situation.   He said he didn't know what his brother was being treated for and that they never talked about it over the phone.   The incident that sparked his hospitalization occurred in November when Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage claiming the government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch videos for ISIS, CBS reported.   A law enforcement official said the FBI interviewed him and then called the police, who took him for a mental health evaluation. The FBI said Santiago stated he did not want to harm anyone, but authorities were concerned by his erratic behavior. They said they closed their assessment of him once he was admitted for treatment.   He was also contacted by the FBI after an employer back in Alaska raised concerns about certain things he had said, according to ABC News.   Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico when he was two years old with his mother and brother.   He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before serving with the Puerto Rico National Guard from 2007. He eventually joined the Alaska National guard from 2014 to 2016.   Santiago was deployed to Iraq in 2010 and spent a year there with the 130th Engineer Battalion.   A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before receiving a general discharge for unsatisfactory performance in August last year.   He had been living in Anchorage, Alaska with his girlfriend for two years before they welcomed a child in September last year.   His aunt Maria Ruiz told  NorthJersey.com  that Santiago had returned from Iraq acting strangely but had seemed happy after the birth of his child.   But she said something happened to him about a month ago and he was hospitalized for two weeks. She did not have details of his condition.   'Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind. He said he saw things,' she said.   His uncle, Hernan Rivera, said: 'Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good.'   Santiago's brother Bryan Santiago speculated about a motive for the shooting, saying he could have suffered a 'flashback' from his time in Iraq, despite never being diagnosed with PTSD, NBC reports.   He said had recently been fighting with people back in Alaska, including his girlfriend with whom he was having relationship issues.   He said Santiago, who was 'was pro-America', has not spoken to his family for several weeks, which was unusual.    The motive for the shooting is still not known, but Florida Senator Marco Rubio told CNN that Santiago may have gotten into an altercation on his flight earlier that morning.     'I know that was mentioned as a potential cause and they wanted to kind of look into that a little further and get to that point,' Rubio said.   Santiago's brother said he had been fighting with people back in Alaska, including his girlfriend with whom he was having relationship issues.   He said Santiago, who was 'was pro-America', has not spoken to his family for several weeks.   'We have not talked for the past three weeks,' Bryan told the Associated Press. 'That's a bit unusual... I'm in shock. He was a serious person... He was a normal person.'   The gunman was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico where his mother and brother still live. He came back to Puerto Rico after serving in Iraq, before moving to Alaska. He lived there from 2014 to 2016 and his girlfriend and child are still there. His most recent address was in Naples, Florida.    Other details about the shooter reveal he had a minor criminal record for traffic violations, according to court records. He was also evicted by his landlord for failing to pay rent in February 2015.   Santiago was charged with fourth-degree assault and damage of property in January 2016, stemming from a domestic violence incident.    In March, Santiago settled the charges by agreeing to complete unknown requirements demanded by prosecutors in exchange for dismissing the case.        It is legal for unloaded firearms to be transported, according to rules set out by the Transportation Security Administration.   Unloaded firearms must be locked in a hard-sided container in checked baggage only.   The firearm and ammunition must be declared to the airline at the baggage counter.   Locked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted.   *Source: Transportation Security Administration    About 90 minutes after the shooting in the airport on Friday, chaos broke out again when police officers were seen rushing into the parking garage with their guns drawn while bystanders sought shelter behind vehicles.   But the Broward County Sheriff said  the only shooting that happened was in Terminal 2 and that he believes only the one gunman was involved.   A witness told  NBC Miami  that the shooter was silent and didn't appear to be targeting anyone in particular - 'popping off bullets at random'.    John Schlicher, who told MSNBC he saw the attack, said the shooter was 'directly firing at us' while passengers waited for their bags to come off the carousel.   In another interview with Fox News, Schlicher said that the shooter was aiming at people's heads.    'All the people seemed to be shot in the head,' Schlicher said. 'He was shooting people who were down on the ground too.'     The shooter reloaded once for a second burst of shooting, Schlicher said, but he could not say how many bullets were fired.          12:57pm - Reports of the shooting emerged. Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said: 'everyone is running'   1:16pm - Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport released a statement confirming there was an 'ongoing incident' at the baggage claim in Terminal 2   1:37pm - Pictures and videos emerged of passengers being evacuated out onto the tarmac   1:50pm - Officials said all services at the airport had been temporarily suspended    2:33pm - TSA issued a second warning. 'Update: Active shooter. Shelter in place.' There were reports of an incident in Terminal 1, where a pilot said they smelled gun powder   2:37pm -  Broward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca said the shooter had landed at the airport on an international flight and collected the gun - which he had checked into his luggage. He then, according to LaMarca, walked into the bathroom, loaded his weapon, then walked back out into the baggage claim and opened fire.     3:33pm - Broward Sheriff Scott Israel said only one person had been arrested in the shooting.     Mark Lea, a 53-year-old financial adviser from Minneapolis, says he was in baggage claim when the shooting started.     'I was dodging bullets and trying to help people get out of the way,' Lea said.    'At first we thought it was firecrackers,' he said. 'Everyone started screaming and running. The shooter made his way down through baggage claim. He had what looked like a 9mm and emptied his entire clip. People were trying to run.'    Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman who was at the scene, tweeted: 'I'm at the Ft Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired. Everyone is running.'   Cellphone video footage broadcast by local Fox television affiliate Channel 7 showed one person lying bloodied on the floor, and several others on their knees.   A passenger named as Peter Cruise said he believed that travelers on his plane were among the victims.   He said he and his family 'were walking up the ramp and just passed the checking gate when all a sudden everybody started running.'   'I grabbed the kids and took off running down the ramp. Told the flight attendant to let us off the tarmac, we ran to hide behind some luggage carts.'   Video from the airport Friday afternoon showed hundreds of passengers corralled together on the tarmac with emergency vehicles parked outside the terminal with lights flashing.        Governor Rick Scott rushed to the airport to be briefed on the shooting, as dozens of police and emergency vehicles converged on the scene.   President-elect Donald Trump said he had spoken with Scott, and was 'monitoring the terrible situation in Florida.'   'Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!' he tweeted.   President Barack Obama has also been briefed on the developing situation.   He told  ABC News  on Friday night that he was 'heartbroken' for the families affected.    'These kinds of tragedies have happened too often during the eight years I have been president. The pain, the grief, the shock that they must be going through is enormous,' he said.   The Florida attack was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have plagued the United States in recent years, some inspired by militants with an extreme view of Islam, others who are loners or mentally disturbed who have easy access to weapons under U.S. gun laws.    Jesse Davis, chief of police at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, said Santiago didn't call attention to himself and 'as far as we can tell' traveled alone from Alaska to Florida.    He said that a firearm was his only piece of checked luggage.    Authorities are trying to track Santiago's movements through Alaska's largest commercial airport using video footage.   Davis noted that it's not usual for travelers at the Alaska airport to check firearms because many people hunt.    A photo of Florida airport gunman Esteban Santiago appears to show him making a jihadist one-fingered salute while wearing a Mid-Eastern keffiyeh sometime prior to him carrying out the shooting massacre.   The 26-year-old Iraq war veteran was pictured in the photo gesturing with his index finger in a pose that has become notorious among supporters of the Islamic State.   Law enforcement officers are currently looking at whether Santiago had any links to ISIS or if he was mentally disturbed as part of their investigation into the deaths of five people in the baggage claim hall at Ft. Lauderdale airport on Friday.   FBI officials said late on Friday night they had not ruled out terrorism and were investigating all angles as they try to determine a motive for the shooting spree.   It was not immediately clear where or when the photo of Santiago was taken in which he appears to be making the jihadist salute.   The traditional Islamic gesture - which refers to the tawhid or 'the belief in the oneness of God' - has been widely adopted by Islamic State supporters (above).   Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev posed in a similar stance in front of an Islamic flag in his bedroom.       A man's laptop remarkably saved him from being struck by a bullet in the deadly shooting at Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport.   Steve Frappier was in the baggage claim area of the airport's terminal when a gunman believed to be Esteban Santiago opened fire on Friday, killing five and injuring six.   Frappier told  CNN  that his laptop, which was in the bag he was carrying on his back, managed to deflect a bullet.   'The backpack saved my life,' he said.    When he dropped to the floor after hearing gunfire, Frappier said his backpack remained on his back.   'I was on the ground like a tortoise with the backpack,' he said.    He said the shooter shot in his direction and he felt something hit his back, but he just assumed it was pieces of nearby luggage given he was not injured.    'It was only later when I went to the bathroom to check myself out that (I found) the bullet had entered my backpack, hit my laptop,' he said.   'Later when I gave my bag to the FBI for investigation, they found the bullet in the pocket of my backpack.'    Frappier took a photo of where the bullet struck his laptop.   He was one of the many inside Terminal 2 of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport when the 26-year-old Iraq war veteran started randomly shooting people with his handgun.",

Scott liaised with Delta to make sure the bags would be sent to the passengers at their first port of call. The governor, who has visited survivors of the attack, also expressed hope that tourists would return to Florida in the future and declared safety a priority.   President Barack Obama meanwhile has said he was 'heartbroken' for the five victims' families, adding that similar attacks have happened too often during his two terms.   Scott came to the airport Saturday morning while authorities continued their investigation. They have identified a primary suspect and have not ruled out terrorism as a motive.   Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport reopened Saturday morning after a 16-hour shutdown. Terminal 2 is still considered a crime scene. Airport officials are now working to reunited displaced travelers with 20,000 items left behind when the attack unfolded Friday afternoon, prompting a frantic evacuation.   Passengers Ronald Mackey and Charod Oliphant approached Governor Scott in Terminal 2 Saturday morning, frustrated that they couldn't find their four bags. They had flown to Fort Lauderdale Friday with their wives to go on a Caribbean cruise and had packed light clothes for the upcoming trip.     'I just explained to the governor my frustration with the process of finding my bag,' Mackey told the Miami Herald.   Mackey had been talking to Delta about finding his luggage and ended up putting the governor on the line, hoping to speed things up.   A representative from the airline said after talking to Scott that Mackey's luggage would be sent to Aruba, the first port of call on the cruise. The two passengers were also promised an allowance to purchase underwear and toiletries in the meantime.     'I think they would have done that anyway,' Oliphant said, adding that talking to the governor probably gave the airline more incentive.   Oliphant recounted being barricaded into a security office for several hours after rumors of a second shooter started spreading into the airport, saying it was a 'harrowing experience'. A SWAT team eventually came to find the travelers, who included children and seniors, he said.   Scott has met with survivors of the attack, some of whom are still in surgery and fighting for their lives.    'We love our tourists and we want them to keep coming back,' Scott said Saturday morning at the airport, according to the  Miami Herald . 'The number one priority for our state is safety.'    President Barack Obama spoke out about the heinous attack in the early hours of Saturday, telling  ABC News  he was 'heartbroken' for the victims' families.     'These kinds of tragedies have happened too often during the eight years I have been president. The pain, the grief, the shock that they must be going through is enormous,' he said.   President-elect Donald Trump said on Twitter he was 'monitoring the terrible situation' in Florida and offered 'thoughts and prayers for all'.",

So far, insurers are only set to pay $30million with the rest of the costs pending. The school is relying on interest revenue from university loans to pay what insurers will not.   The school claims donations, student tuition, and taxpayer funds are not being used to pay these expenses.   The school also was hit in November with a $2.4 million fine from a federal investigation, started immediately after Sandusky was arrested, that concluded the university repeatedly violated campus crime reporting requirements.    There are several ongoing legal actions pertaining to the Sandusky scandal.   Former Penn State President Graham Spanier, former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Vice President Gary Schultz are accused of not responding properly to McQueary's 2001 complaint that Sandusky was sexually abusing a boy in a team shower. They are also accused of putting children in danger.    All three have said they are innocent.    Penn State countersued Spanier last month, saying he violated his employment agreement by not disclosing what he knew about Sandusky before Sandusky's 2011 arrest. The school is seeking repayment of millions of dollars it has paid him over the past five years.   Spanier's lawsuit claims the school violated an agreement made when he was pushed out of the top job - days after Sandusky was charged - by making public comments that were critical of him and not living up to promises regarding office space, teaching opportunities and payment of legal costs.   A judge has scheduled a hearing later this month in a lawsuit by Spanier against former FBI Director Louis Freeh and his law firm, who were paid by Penn State to produce a 2012 report into how Spanier and other top administrators handled the Sandusky matter.   Judge Robert Eby will hear oral argument in Freeh's preliminary objections to the lawsuit. Spanier is seeking damages for the reputational and economic harm he alleges resulted from the report.   The family of former Penn State head coach Joe Paterno is suing the NCAA, saying it damaged the Paterno estate's commercial interests by relying on conclusions about Paterno in the Freeh report. Two former Paterno assistants, son Jay Paterno and Bill Kenney, are also suing, saying they have not been able to find comparable work because of the Freeh report. The most recent action in that case involved a dispute over subpoenas. Paterno died in 2012.    Sandusky is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence in Greene State Prison on a 45-count conviction for sexual abuse of 10 boys, and he is currently pursuing an appeal in county court near State College.   In November, the judge handling that appeal - Judge John Cleland, who was also the trial judge - took himself off the case after Sandusky's lawyers raised objections to Cleland's role in a December 2011 meeting in a hotel the night before Sandusky waived a preliminary hearing.   Cleland's sternly worded order included a footnote saying his review of the 34 issues raised by Sandusky found none of them had merit.   The state court system is working on appointing a new judge, but that decision has not been made.",

'Just talking about it makes you beam,' he said as he clenched his ticket, grinning from ear-to-ear.   Obama's final speech to the public will continue a tradition set in 1796 when George Washington addressed the American people for the last time as president.    It will be followed by a 'family reunion' for alumni of Obama's former campaigns, according to a save-the-date.   Obama has described the event as 'a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey,' to celebrate the ways the country has changed and 'to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.'   For many supporters, Obama's decision to give the speech in Chicago rather than Washington added to the significance of the event.    It was in Chicago's Grant Park that in 2008 he delivered his victory speech after becoming the nation's first black president.   'He's coming home,' said Cheryl Bellamy-Bonner, 56, who volunteered on Obama's 2004 U.S. Senate campaign.    'It shows he really cares about the people.'   Bellamy-Bonner said she appreciated Obama's professionalism in office and his support of diversity.    She explained that if there have been any disappointments in his administration, it's that he couldn't accomplish more, which she blamed on a lack of bipartisanship.   On Tuesday night, she's hoping to hear what Obama will do next and 'what we can do to help.'   Organizers didn't say how many tickets were available, but many people walked away empty-handed on Saturday.   Among them was Stacy Bond.    The 28-year-old from suburban Evanston said she's disheartened about President-elect Donald Trump and wanted to be in the room to hear directly from Obama, the first president she voted for after reaching the legal voting age.   'You kind of want to hold on to that last bit of him that we've had,' she said.   The White House says the farewell address also will be streamed live online.    Obama will be joined by first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.",

He said earlier: 'Trump may ask whoever he wants, but still neither myself nor Mexico are going to pay for his racist monument. Another promise he can't keep.'    Scroll down for video    Quesada and Trump have previously sparred on the topic of the  wall which was Trump's most famous campaign promise.   Quesada has consistently said Mexico will not pay for the wall.   During a campaign rally in February,  Trump responded to this statement by saying the wall 'just got 10 feet taller'.   Beyond just the wall, Quesada also voiced his other qualms about Trump via Twitter.    'Sr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating. Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?,' he tweeted Friday.   Current Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has also maintained the wall will not be funded by Mexico.   In an interview with  CNN  he said: 'There is no way that Mexico can pay [for] a wall like that.'   On Trump's campaign website, in a 664 word plan, it states Mexico will pay for the wall or the US will  block wire transfers to Mexico. The site also states there would be higher visa fees as a cash source.   Friday, congressional Republicans started plans for building the wall along the southern border before Mexico has agreed to pay.   It could be funded as soon as April through the appropriations process. Trump has stated this will not cost the US taxpayers.    Trump told the  New York Times  in a phone interview: 'We\u2019re going to get reimbursed.'   'But I don\u2019t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed.'   Trump then called the media 'dishonest' for reporting that US taxpayers would be fronting the wall and not Mexico.",

The brown howler monkey gave Brazilian traffic cops the run around along the Imigrantes highway in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.   The mischievous chimp kept officers chasing after it for more than an hour across the motorway as lorries, coaches and cars were forced to stop until the animal was safely captured.    The major route cuts through the dense tropical Atlantic rainforest and the ape, weighing around six kilos, emerged and crossed several lanes of traffic on Thursday afternoon.   The Howler, which is indigenous to the south-east region of Brazil, was first spotted by a concerned motorist as it tried to cross at junction 27, the turnoff for S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo city.   The driver alerted authorities  before rescuers arrived, flagging down vehicles and blocking the lanes while the monkey got up to its tricks.   Motorway cameras track the high jinks as a highway police officer follows the monkey  across the lanes and tries to coax the animal off the dangerous thoroughfare.   But the cheeky monkey isn't having any of it.   Instead it can be seen totally disobeying the officer's request and scurrying from one side to the other.    One officer and then another joins the chase and follows patiently behind the creature, even pointing to where the mammal should go.       The ape was eventually trapped by environmental agents from Ecovias concessionaire, the company responsible for managing the Imigrantes highway, and animal welfare experts.   Nearly a dozen rescuers were involved in the rescue effort.   The captured beast was taken to the Estoril Park Zoo, in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo.    Environmental experts believe the recent expansion of the motorway has disrupted and disorientated wildlife in the region and incidents like this 'are to be expected'.   Experts also speculated the lone creature may have lost its mate in a motorway accident and could have been trying to find new company.   Major highway engineering works have seen the construction of long tunnels and colossal six lane flyovers built through the rainforest.   The Imigrantes route connects the city of Sao Paulo to the Atlantic coast and the seaside resorts of Sao Vicente and Praia Grande.   The Atlantic rainforest expanse spreads through the Brazilian states of Bahia and Espirito Santo through Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo down to the Misiones in the Argentina.   The brown howler monkeys, which have a healthy population, are known for their loud howls and roars and live in groups of two to 11 individuals.",

Her friend, television producer Pepper Jay, revealed to  The Hollywood Reporter  that the actress had been battling cancer.    Scroll down for video    York never married but was the companion of director Vincent Sherman for a decade until his death in 2006.    She is  survived by several nieces and nephews as well as grandnieces and grandnephews.   At the time of her death she was completing her autobiography, according to THR.    Before launching her Hollywood career, the Minnesota native had been a model and showgirl at the Moulin Rouge nightclub on Sunset Boulevard.   Her film debut came in 1962 in  Secret File: Hollywood where she played a magazine editor.      The 5ft 8in beauty was the moll of the supervillain Bookworm on Batman in 1966 and played Venus de Milo on Bewitched.     Her credits included a slew of 1960s and 1970s hit shows, such as The Odd Couple, Green Acres, Love, American Style, Ironside and Burke's Law.   More recently she appeared on The Mindy Project in 2015 and Hot in Cleveland in 2012.   In 2000 she played the mother-in-law of Nicolas Cage in The Family Man.   In Doll Squad she was the leader of a group of sexy female assassins. The 1970s film supposedly inspired TV's Charlie's Angels.    One of her favorite roles was Lorraine Temple, a blackmailer and former prostitute, on the soap opera Days of Our Lives in 1978.   'This was the role of roles but it was hard work,' she told Tom Lisanti in his book Fantasy Femmes of Sixties Cinema.   'One underestimates actors who toil on soaps,' she said. 'You have to learn pages of dialogue in a day and just before you go to shoot it they hand you all these changes.'",

A court heard that June Humphreys, 79, of Crewe, Cheshire, began shoplifting in her mid-70s as she wanted something to do and  to get out her hometown.   She regularly travels around using her free bus pass pocketing hundreds of pounds worth of goods by swiping them off shelves and hiding them in her trolley.   The pensioner was most recently caught by a supermarket security guard after stealing items from two stores in Stafford on December 12 last year.   When quizzed by officers she told them: 'I'm bored I suppose. I just wanted to get out of Crewe.'   Humphreys was flanked by security guards and hunched over a shopping trolley as she made her way into Cannock Magistrates Court to admit two counts of theft on Friday.   The OAP was fined \u00a380 and told to also pay \u00a3135 costs and a \u00a330 surcharge.   Sentencing, chairwoman of the bench Mrs Lisa Elkington-Bourne said: 'You have got quite a prolific history from over the last few years so it's difficult to know how to deal with it.   'We are going to fine you.'   The court heard Humphreys had 38 previous convictions, all for matters of dishonesty, committed after she reached her mid-seventies.   When asked why she had taken goods worth \u00a323.50 on December 12, she told police officers: 'I don't know why I did it, I just took them, alright?   'I don't know. I don't get anything out of it.'   The prolific crook was caught by a Sainsbury's security guard after she took stationery worth \u00a34 from the supermarket.   In her shopping trolley there were two packs of Pampers nappies and baby milk worth \u00a319.50.   The items had been stolen from the Wilko store in the town earlier that day.   The court also heard police had issued a warrant for Humphreys' arrest after she failed to arrive at court for a scheduled hearing on December 30.   Neil O'Driscoll, defending, said she had tried to get a bus to Cannock from Crewe but was unaware where she had to go and got lost.   He added: 'But she managed find her way to the court today.'   Previously, JPs were told how Humphreys would target stores and has stolen items such as clothes, alcohol and a breast pump.   Her probation officer Darren Vernon told the court at a past hearing: 'She has travelled around Staffordshire and Cheshire on public transport and committed offences.   'She knows what she is doing is wrong, she says she is bored and needs to fill her time.   'The main reason for her doing this is boredom. She lives alone.   'She has seven children but the only one she has contact with lives above her.   'She has acquired the record of a heroin addict in his late teens.'",

Locals said a rigged tanker caused the explosion and blamed Islamic State militants, who have carried out attacks in the town before. The militant group has been increasingly pressed in Syria and Iraq, and has escalated its attacks against Turkey -- which backs Syrian opposition fighters in a campaign against the group in northern Syria. \n Azaz, only a couple of miles from the Turkish border, is a key town on a route used by opposition fighters moving between Syria and Turkey, and is a hub for anti-government activists as well as many displaced from the recent fighting in Aleppo city. Activists say its pre-war population of 30,000 has swelled. \n \n \n \n \n \n It is also sandwiched between rival groups, including Kurdish fighters to the west and Turkey-backed opposition groups to the east. Islamic State militants, who have tried to advance on the key border town before have been pushed back farther east in recent months in the Turkey-backed offensive. \n The bomb went off early Saturday afternoon outside a local courthouse and security headquarters operated by the opposition fighters who control the town, resident and activist Saif Alnajdi told The Associated Press from Azaz. \n \"It hit the busiest part of the town,\" Alnajdi said, referring to the administrative part of town. \n A medical worker speaking to a local media outfit, al-Jisr, said many charred bodies, and body parts mixed with bones and mud, were piled up in local hospitals. \n Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, said at least 48 people were killed, including 14 fighters and guards to the local courthouse. He said the explosion was caused by a rigged water or fuel tanker, which explained the large blast and high death toll. The activist-operated local Azaz Media center and Shabha Press put the death toll at 60, adding that search and rescue operations continued for hours after the explosion. \n Alnajdi said rescue workers were still working to identify and remove the bodies from the area, suggesting that the death toll was not final. He said some of the severely wounded were transported across the border into the Turkish town of Kilis for treatment. The Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency said 53 wounded Syrians were brought to Kilis' local hospital for treatment, including five in critical condition, transferred to Gaziantep. The agency said one later died. \n Media activist Baha al-Halabi, based in Aleppo province and who gathered information from Azaz residents, said witnesses reported many unidentified bodies. Footage shared online showed a large plume of black smoke rising above the chaotic street with the sound of gunfire in the background as onlookers gathered around the site. In one instance, a father ran away from the scene, carrying his child to safety. \n The court house and the security headquarters were damaged, as well as the Red Crescent and municipality offices, according to activists in the area. \n Many rebels and civilians who were pushed out of Aleppo city during a massive government offensive late last year have resettled in Azaz. Syrian Kurdish forces control territory to the west of Azaz, and have often tried advancing toward the town, causing friction with Turkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters. To the east, opposition fighters backed by Turkey have been pushing back Islamic State extremists, gaining territory and advancing on the IS-stronghold town of al-Bab, further east. Turkey considers Syria Kurdish factions there terrorists, linked to a local group it is battling at home. \n A nationwide week-long cease-fire has mostly held across most of Syria after Russia and Turkey, who support opposite sides of the conflict, reached an agreement late December. It is set to pave the way for peace talks between Assad's government and the opposition in Kazakhstan later this month. The Islamic State group and al-Qaida-linked group Fatah al-Sham Front are not included in the deal, according to the Syrian government.",

   "7. content": "Iran\u2019s intelligence agency allegedly planned terrorist attacks against organizations and representatives engaged in pro-Israel work in Germany, according to German media reports citing the country\u2019s federal prosecutor released on Friday. \n Syed Mustafa H., a 31-year-old Pakistani who worked for the German Aerospace Center in Bremen, was indicted on Monday for alleged espionage. \n West German Broadcasting (WDR) reported Iran\u2019s intelligence agency\u2019s goal was to assassinate the former president of the German-Israel friendship society, Reinhold Robbe. From 1994 to 2005, Robbe served as a Social Democratic Party deputy in the Bundestag. He later served as the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces in the Bundestag. \n Iran\u2019s targeting of a German politician is the first reported case of an Iranian intelligence operation working to assassinate a government representative in the Federal Republic. Journalist Georg Heil, who wrote the WDR article, reported that Mustafa also spied on a French-Israeli professor at a business college in Paris. \n The professor and the college in Paris were not identified in the report. \n The WDR reported that a second Pakistani suspect was arrested but was later released due to insufficient evidence. The suspect scrubbed his entire computer server of possibly incriminating information and departed the Federal Republic after his detainment. \n According to the Berlin-based Tagesspiegel newspaper, Mustafa was likely working for Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mustafa studied engineering at Bremerhaven College and provided PowerPoint presentations to Iran\u2019s intelligence agency. WDR said Mustafa communicated inaccurate information about Robbe. \n Iran\u2019s regime paid Mustafa for the information he secured, according to the indictment. He drafted a \u201cmovement profile\u201d of Robbe and surveyed the society headquarters in Berlin. According to German authorities, Mustafa\u2019s activity was \u201ca clear indication of an assassination attempt.\u201d \n Mustafa also followed Robbe during his commute on public transportation from his private residence to his office. \n The indictment states Mustafa had been in contact with a person from Iran\u2019s intelligence agency responsible for espionage in Europe since 2011. German media said Mustafa\u2019s espionage activity was part of a larger Iranian operation to target pro-Israel groups in France, Germany and other European countries. \n According to WDR, the motive for the attack \u2013 based on one security theory \u2013 is Iran\u2019s desire to retaliate against Israeli advocates in Europe in the event that Israel launched air strikes to knock out Tehran\u2019s nuclear facilities. \n Mustufa is suspected of intelligence activity from July 2015 to July 2016 on behalf of Iran\u2019s regime.  \n In July, a Berlin court convicted an Iranian man of espionage on behalf of Iran\u2019s regime. The 32-year-old man was sentenced to nearly two-and-a-half years in prison for spying on Iranian dissidents in Germany. The Jerusalem Post\u2019s review of German intelligence reports showed Iran ratcheted up its spy network in the Federal Republic in 2015. Iran has a vast espionage infrastructure in the country which coordinates with its embassy in Berlin. \n Benjamin Weinthal reports on human rights in the Middle East and is a fellow at the  Foundation for Defense of Democracies .

   "7. content": "And the world goes on regardless of joy or despair or one woman\u2019s fortune or one man\u2019s loss. And we can\u2019t know the lives of others.   From The Gap Of Time by Jeanette Winterson   Dear Bel,   I live with my partner and our young daughter. We\u2019re engaged and on the whole have a really good relationship. But last year was challenging with quite a few arguments \u2014 never about the big stuff, just stupid things.   My mum lives near and helps with childcare as we both work full time. My partner\u2019s parents live far away and have bought a house nearby \u2014 but have not been able to sell their other home yet to move permanently. My partner\u2019s father also has cancer.   I have a decent relationship with my in-laws, but they upset me a few times last year. They were often in our locality house-hunting, but never stayed with us or made the effort to come and see their granddaughter, even though they told my partner how much they missed her.   They also did not come to her birthday party, which I couldn\u2019t understand.   They\u2019ve turned up at very short notice to their house nearby, expecting to have our daughter at very short notice \u2014 on days my mum has her. Mum has been really upset, so once I said no, as she had plans. They were not happy.   However, they\u2019ve been offered time with our daughter on numerous occasions, but there\u2019s always an excuse.   I\u2019ve given up contacting my partner\u2019s mother as I never get a response and genuinely don\u2019t know what I have done to upset her.   We\u2019ve just had an upset over some babysitting arrangements, as a result of which I did speak rather sharply. She shouted I\u2019d made her feel small. I said I was really sorry, I hadn\u2019t meant to upset her, loved her to bits and the last thing I wanted was to argue.   She kept on until my partner came in. Then her whole demeanour changed and she said she\u2019d accept my apology.   Then I did shout at her \u2014 saying she was happy to have a go until her son appeared, then played the hard-done-to martyr. At that, his parents stormed out of our home.   Yesterday my partner visited them with our daughter, then had a go at me for displaying a grudge against his mother all year. That\u2019s really unfair, as I\u2019ve gone out of my way to do things for them.   He says he\u2019s close to leaving over the way I spoke to her. Our relationship is on really shaky ground. I\u2019m not perfect and acknowledge there have been times I over-reacted.   A number of arguments have been my fault.   But I love him very much and don\u2019t want us to split up. I can\u2019t bear the look of upset, hurt and disappointment in his eyes.   What can I do?   ROSIE   Readers often say they worry that publication of somebody\u2019s letter will make the situation worse. Though I change names and omit details, a story can often be easily identified by those involved.   Sometimes I actually wish all those involved in pretty common conflicts would indeed read this page; look at each other with annoyance; then horror; have serious conversations; then come to their senses and vow to co-exist with courtesy.   Here, we have a couple with a two-year-old daughter who have chosen a sort of commitment, then stalled.   Why didn\u2019t you get married? I can\u2019t help wondering if this plays any part (even subconsciously) in your own general tetchiness, because you fear your partner is not fully committed.   It\u2019s just a thought to challenge you because you need to start by identifying the flash points (those \u2018stupid things\u2019) in the relationship and working out how to avoid them.   You admit a lot of it begins with you; the big question is: \u2018Why?\u2019   It\u2019s clear from your letter (three times as long as I print here) that not all your problems are caused by the in-laws, so you need to analyse what\u2019s going on.   You could do with some counselling sessions together to kick start the process \u2014 because there\u2019s much confusion and self-deception in your email.   You told your mother-in-law you \u2018love her to bits\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s not true. You\u2019re very critical of your partner\u2019s parents, and with some reason.   You gave many examples of how you feel let down by them, your main feeling is probably acute disappointment \u2014 you adore your child and cannot understand why they don\u2019t want to spend as much time with her as possible.   You also told me a story of how they missed your birthday (apart from a cheque), which clearly hurt your feelings. I wish they would understand that, in fact, you would like to receive more attention than they seem capable of giving.   But here, surely you in turn must consider that your father-in-law\u2019s health will preoccupy them much of the time.   That, together with the stress of not being able to sell their first house, will subject them to a lot of strain \u2014 and surely you need to show a little more understanding?   Y ou are younger; you have your mother nearby to help; they are your boyfriend\u2019s parents. All this signals that you need to grow up a little, control your temper, and find ways of coping \u2014 for the sake of the relationship you value and the child who is its product.   Surely there are two issues here. First, there is your relationship with your partner, with all its tensions. Second, there is your relationship with his parents.   Here\u2019s the truth. They are his parents, therefore they are in your life \u2014 and the only way forward is to vow to treat them with respect and affection, even if you find that hard. The second may help the first, and dealing with the first may help the second.   Think about it before it\u2019s too late.    Can I stop my child's abusive marriage?   Dear Bel,   Three years ago, my only daughter called me and said she needed help to leave her husband (whom I\u2019ll never call my son-in-law).   My husband (not her father, but always loved her like a daughter) immediately said to give her the money. It was nearly \u00a32,000.   Then, 18 months later, she said she was going back to her husband. Although I wasn\u2019t happy about it, I respected her decision, as she is an adult. But I told my husband, \u2018We\u2019ll just wait for the next phone call.\u2019   The call came in March 2016; then, she arrived at our extremely small house with our two grandchildren and stayed three nights.   He phoned over 100 times, then she had to return home (50 miles away), as the girls were missing school. Three months later, things came to a head again. Her husband is so convinced she\u2019s having an affair, he has fitted a tracker to her car, followed her to work, hiding down the lane where they live so often that the neighbours call him \u2018paranoid Joe\u2019.   She has never given him cause \u2014 but his first wife apparently cheated on him before she died, so he thinks all women are the same. We gave her another \u00a3600 as he hadn\u2019t worked and wouldn\u2019t claim any benefits. Now we have found out she\u2019s once again taken him back despite the CPS prosecuting him for coercive control.   Now she won\u2019t answer her phone when I call, but texts saying she\u2019ll call. I understand she is embarrassed and ashamed to be back with him, but I miss her so much and don\u2019t know what to do.   BARBARA     This is every parent\u2019s nightmare; there will be many people reading this who endure the daily pain of knowing their daughter is married to a terrible man.   Sometimes, the situation can escalate into something truly frightening. But let\u2019s not dwell on that; enough to say your daughter is locked into a relationship with an obsessive, jealous man, has summoned the courage to walk out, then twice went back to him.   Let\u2019s be in no doubt that a woman in her situation is usually constrained by psychological chains that are just as strong as real fetters. Why do women stay with men who bully and/or beat them? For many complicated reasons, including the belief that he might change.   Because you detest your son-in-law, you can have no idea of why they got together in the first place, or the nature of her bond with him.   I should make it clear what the CPS prosecution means. Coercive behaviour is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse, used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.   Controlling behaviour is a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour.   This is serious and in your situation I would certainly have given the money to help my daughter leave \u2014 yes, then given more, too.   The question is, what can you do now? A key factor must be what is happening to the grandchildren. This unpleasant, worrying situation can only have a detrimental effect on their mental well-being, so it must be watched. I would like their school to know what\u2019s going on, but doubt your daughter has given anything away.   Might it be an idea for you to write a proper letter, in total confidence, to the head-teacher, spelling everything out and simply requesting that he/she is vigilant?   You are 50 miles away; the teachers are close at hand and those children have the right to have concerned people looking out for them. The man\u2019s behaviour sounds out of control; it\u2019s all very well for the neighbours to make a joke about it, but the situation is far from funny.   Would it be a good idea for you and your husband to visit? You could tell your daughter you miss her and the grandchildren, therefore you and her stepfather want to book a B&B near them, picking the kids up from school, and so on.   If she is \u2018ashamed\u2019 as you suggest, she won\u2019t like this idea at all, but she may not stop you. Surely it\u2019s vital you keep in constant touch with her and the children, even if she makes it difficult?   Naturally, I believe she needs counselling to give her the strength to leave this marriage, which can only be harming her and the children, but have no idea how she can be forced to realise that truth. I pray she does.    And Finally: Why good manners matter...   It always intrigues me \u2014 the way you respond to items here. Who would have thought that last week\u2019s main letter from \u2018Marlene\u2019 \u2014 about thank-you letters \u2014 would attract such a response?   Robin and I were in a supermarket in Keynsham on the day it was printed, and a lady came up and said: \u2018I was just reading you! You are so right about thank-you letters.\u2019   We then had a really enjoyable conversation (and by the way, everyone, I never, ever mind readers coming up to talk to me; on the contrary, I love it), agreeing that appreciation is vital within human relationships. Oh, that sounds pretentious, so how about, \u2018It\u2019s terrific to say Ta\u2019?   The serious point concerns manners. I just received an invitation to the Oldie Magazine\u2019s 2017 Oldie of the Year Awards. Last year, I went for the first time and it was great fun. But I was curious that they felt the need to paperclip a slip of paper to the invitation.   Bel answers readers\u2019 questions on emotional and relationship problems each week. Write to Bel Mooney, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT, or e-mail bel.mooney@dailymail.co.uk. A pseudonym will be used if you wish. Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.    It says: \u2018It is a seated lunch, so please tell us if, after having accepted, you\u2019re no longer able to come. This is simply because if you don\u2019t, another guest will have an empty seat next to them \u2014 and we will still have to pay for your lunch.\u2019   It\u2019s amazing that plea is necessary \u2014 given those on the guest list are all of a certain age and (I\u2019d assumed) pretty civilised.   Clearly not. I can\u2019t be the only one who has been surprised (this ten years ago) when guests accepted an invitation to a special party in London then failed to show \u2014 even though I\u2019d paid for canapes for a certain number.   Emails make staying in touch so easy, so there is no excuse for rudeness.   If the older generation fails to set an example, what hope is there for the young?   If parents don\u2019t insist the little ones say \u2018Please\u2019 and \u2018Thank you\u2019 and \u2018Can I help you\u2019, then what hope is there for society?   This is no exaggeration. Good manners means respect; a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. We all need to show \u2014 as well as tell \u2014 that this is classy and cool.",

The patent description explains that a collective aerial drone would be capable of transporting 'virtually any size, weight, or quantity of items.'   The average drone can typically fly continuously for up to 30 minutes and can only transport items weighing up to 10 pounds.        Last month the company revealed that it had made its first aircraft delivery and claimed to have dropped off the package just 13 minutes after it was ordered.   However, investigations later showed that the parcel, containing an Amazon Fire TV box and a bag of popcorn, were flown from Amazon's drone testing site near Cambridge, across one field to a farmhouse just 765 yards away.    Amazon has spent millions of pounds developing its drone service. In July the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) lifted strict drone flying restrictions to enable the company to start testing its drones.   It means Amazon is allowed to have one pilot controlling multiple autonomous drones and can operate a drone without a direct line of sight.    Over the summer Amazon secretly flew its drones in a field, around five miles east of its research and development centre in Cambridge.   It built a wall of haybales to hide the testing area, but the drone could be spotted when it was flying in the sky.   The secret site also contains a blue control tower, with a five-metre tall antenna, and a manicured landing site, the size of a football pitch to resemble a front garden.   The area is constantly patrolled by security men and vans, with Amazon keen to keep its latest development to itself.   Amazon has also applied for a patent for anti-collision avoidance systems on their drones.   The company has stated the drones will cruise below 400ft, carrying packages up to 5lbs and guided by GPS.   Amazon does not require a licence for the drones but once it rolls out the service further it will need to obtain the permission of the Civil Aviation Authority for every delivery as all commercial drone flights must be approved by the body.    Questions over the safe use of drones remain, however, with a number of near-misses involving commercial aircraft and amateur drone pilots reported this year.   Amazon has proposed using its crafts in 'segregated blocks of airspace below 500 feet and away from most manned aviation operations'.    The firm also said its drones will use 'sense and avoid' technology and data will be continuously gathered throughout the trial to make improvements, calling safety its 'top priority'.   The company added that the current trial was only permitted to operate during daylight hours with low winds and good visibility, and not in rain, snow or icy conditions.   On its website Amazon said: 'It looks like science fiction, but it's real. One day, seeing Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road.'   A spokesman for the CAA said it was 'too early' to talk about granting Amazon exemptions for commercial flights for 'out of line of sight' flights on a national scale.   The spokesman added the company would likely have to get Government approval to pursue such an extension.   Earlier this year Amazon got British approval for three new types of tests, including flying drones that are no longer within sight of their operators in rural and suburban areas.   The other two are having one person operate several highly automated drones and testing devices to make the drones able to identify and avoid obstacles.    Similar technology to Amazon's megadrone has been developed elsewhere, including in Norway.    A team from the University of Oslo team spent 18 months building a large unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), dubbed the Megakopter.   It contains 13 propellers and eight hexacopters powered by a total of 48 motors that reside on a frame built from aluminum and plywood.   In October 2015, it broke the world record by lifting a payload of 61kg(134lb 7.6oz) into the air and holding it there for 37 seconds, elevated to a height of at least one meter at all times.   The team behind the unmaned vehicle hope it could eventually be used to transport people - although Norwegian authorities did not grant them permission to carry out test flights with humans on board.",

Officials say the fire was started 'deliberately'.   The sheriff's office said it does not believe there is a danger to the public and that no suspects are being sought, but won't comment on evidence or give more details as the investigation continues.    Investigators were trying to piece together what took place in the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday, when firefighters found a home, a shop and detached garage ablaze.   The property is near the town of Hubbard amid hop farms in the Willamette Valley off Interstate 5, between Portland and Salem.   Lt. Chris Baldrige told the station  KATU  that each of the fires ignited separately, describing the case as a complex criminal investigation, which is expected to continue into the weekend.   Emily Hamberger told  OregonLive.com  she has learned from some mutual friends that the Kroekers, whom she knew from church, hosted a dinner party Monday night, just hours before the fires ravaged their home.             When their friends left, Erin and Keith's three children were getting ready for bed.   Hamberger said Keith Kroeker was an elder at the Mid Valley Community Church and his wife helped with the children's choir.   Firefighters responded to reports of a house fire at about 3am on Tuesday and found three different structures, which were not close together, alight. About 30 minutes later, the first dead body was found in the smoldering debris.    About 100 first responders, among them 40 investigators, spent three days sifting through piles of the debris.    The work at the site has been made more difficult due to the size of the crime scene, the extent of the damage to the structures and low temperatures, which caused the thousands of gallons of water used to put out the flames to freeze over.   Neighbor Michelle Palacios said the Kroeker family have been there for years, the Woodburn Independent newspaper reported.   'We've always been neighborly ... we've gone to each other's jewelry parties, we've exchanged Christmas cookies,' Palacios was quoted as saying. 'This is just bizarre.'      Their three children attended Lincoln Elementary School, where grief counselors have been made available to students and staff.",

Authorities say he was armed with a semi-automatic handgun from a checked bag after landing in Ft. Lauderdale on the second leg of a flight from Alaska. Six people were wounded. \n FBI AGENT WHO INTERROGATED SADDAM HUSSEIN LEADS AIRPORT CASE \n The dead also included another person going on a cruise. \n Michael Oehme was a frequent traveler who loved to cruise with his wife, and the couple was about to head out to sea again, his sister told The Associated Press on Saturday. \n \"They were supposed to leave today,\" Elizabeth Oehme-Miller, 52, said by phone from Council Bluffs, Iowa, also the couple's hometown. \"They were happy to be going on another trip.\" \n Oehme, 57, was a land surveyor and owned his own business, Boundaryline Surveys, his sister said. \n His wife, Kari Oehme, is hospitalized with injuries from a gunshot wound to the shoulder and is expected to recover, her sister-in-law said. Kari Oehme is a clerical worker at a local office, Oehme-Miller said. \n She said she learned that the couple was at the airport during the shooting through a text message from her daughter. \n \"I still can't believe it's true,\" Oehme-Miller said. \"It hasn't hit yet. I'm kind of in shock right now.\" \n WAVY-TV  reported that a third victim was 62-year-old Terry Andres, of Virginia Beach. \n Andres and his wife, Ann, flew to Fort Lauderdale for a Caribbean cruise, one of many they'd taken together over the years. Because they loved to travel, they'd booked a second trip immediately following the cruise, a week in Cancun, Mexico. \n The night before they left their Virginia Beach home, the couple offered their generator to neighbors as a snowstorm bore down on the region. After hearing about the shooting, friend Jessica Winbauer texted the couple. \n \"She texted me back about an hour and a half later saying 'Please call me,\" Winbauer told The Associated Press, holding back tears. \n That's when Ann Andres broke the news: her husband was one of the five victims. \n \n \n \n \n Expand / Contract \n \n \n \n This undated photo provided by Julia Dwyer on Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017 shows her friends, Ann Andres and her husband, Terry, of Virginia Beach, Va.

Neighbors visited with one another to share the news or made the rare phone call to fill-in people who had moved away. \n \"It's like a commune back here,\" said Winbauer, whose son is the Andres' godchild. \"Everyone has keys to everybody's house. Everyone is connected.\" \n Tragedy struck an Ohio family when Shirley Timmons was slain and her husband critically injured during the airport attack. \n The couple had flown to Fort Lauderdale on Friday to join the rest of their family for a cruise,  WILE-FM  reported. \n Timmons' grandson Steve Reineccius confirmed over Facebook that his grandmother was one of the victims and that his grandfather Steve Timmons was wounded. They were both 70 years old. \n Timmons was shot in the head and underwent emergency surgery at a Fort Lauderdale hospital, where he's in critical condition, the station reported. \n The couple's 51st wedding anniversary was in three weeks. They're from Senecaville, about 90 miles east of Columbus. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

   "7. content": "The boyfriend of tragic singer George Michael looked tired this morning as he went for a stroll in Regent's Park today, equipped with a large camera.   Fadi Fawaz, who found the 53-year-old star dead in his bed at his Oxfordshire home on Christmas morning, had a five year relationship with the singer.   Fadi, 40, was seen this morning photographing wildlife in the north London park.   Wearing a black jacket and turquoise Adidas jogging bottoms, he looked tired as he took pictures on an SLR camera.   With his hood pulled up, Fadi repeatedly stopped to look at the images he had taken on the camera's screen.   It emerged that he was questioned by police on Wednesday this week over the star's death, but said officers had been 'amazing' and 'supportive'.   The former hairdresser, who has been trying to make a career as a photographer, told them he spent Christmas Eve with the singer but fell asleep in his car that night and only discovered that he was dead when he went to wake him the following morning.   When news of the death was announced on Christmas Day, George Michael \u2014 who had a history of drug abuse \u2014 was said by his manager to have died of \u2018heart failure\u2019.   However, an initial post mortem examination was inconclusive. Now toxicology tests will be done alongside a report for the coroner, aiming to discover what was behind his early death.   On Thursday  it emerged that Fadi will be questioned again by police, who will be aiming to put together a full picture of the singer\u2019s movements and state of mind in the last week of his life.   They have already taken a statement from a photographer who took pictures of Fadi going in and out of George Michael\u2019s house with a take-away coffee on December 24, and are expected to speak to George\u2019s family and friends.   Fadi said: \u2018The police have been amazing. They have been supportive. They have done what normally happens when someone dies. They have not been accusing me, never; they have been very supportive.\u2019   However, questions continue to swirl around Fadi Fawaz \u2014 and not just why he slept in his car rather than in the singer\u2019s home on the night before George\u2019s death. He has also been accused of being a former porn actor.   After he and George Michael started dating in 2011, numerous websites suggested he had previously appeared in a gay porn film, Matchmaker, under the name Isaac Mazar. It is a claim that Fadi denies.   Yesterday, however, Felix Kamp, the CEO of the film company Cazzo, which made the movie, told the Mail: \u2018We have had a lot of inquiries and, yes, I can confirm Fadi is Isaac, who starred in the Matchmaker movie.\u2019   In addition, some in George\u2019s camp feel Fadi\u2019s social media activity since George\u2019s death has been, at best, ill-advised.   On New Year\u2019s Day, a string of posts appeared on Twitter asserting that he and George were together 24/7 and that the singer had repeatedly tried to take his life and had finally succeeded. But the posts were quickly taken down, with Fadi claiming his account had been hacked.   There is also a belief among sources close to George that Fadi will not be a beneficiary of George\u2019s will, which will divide the singer\u2019s \u00a3105 million fortune. His sisters and charities \u2014 including Childline and the Terrence Higgins Trust \u2014 are said to be in line to benefit.   And speculation is rife that Fadi will not be able to continue living in George\u2019s \u00a34 million central London mews house near Regent\u2019s Park for much longer.   The star bought the house in 1998. In 2006, he lent it to Geri Halliwell as a place to stay away from prying eyes after she had her daughter Bluebell.   Neighbours believe Fadi has been staying there on and off for several months, which might suggest that the two men were in an arm\u2019s length romance.",

He was too weak for surgery,  TMZ reported  Thursday. \n A corrections official told the Times on Friday that Manson returned to the prison where he was serving his life sentence. \n DOZENS KILLED, BRUTALIZED IN BRAZILIAN PRISON RIOT; WORST IN DECADES \n A petty criminal who had been in and out of jail since childhood, Manson reinvented himself during the Summer of Love as a long-haired, Christ-like guru spouting Bible verses and Beatles lyrics. \n After attracting a few dozen followers from San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, many of them young women, runaways or other lost souls, he took them to an old movie ranch on the edge of Los Angeles that he transformed into a commune of sex, drugs and music. \n \n \n \n \n \n On Aug. 9 and 10, 1969, he sent some of his devotees out on a murderous mission to two of Los Angeles' wealthiest neighborhoods, where they killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate, several of her society friends and others. Most of the victims, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger, were stabbed. \n Tate's husband, Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski, was out of the country at the time. \n Authorities would learn that Manson had hoped the killings would touch off a race war. He had apparently gotten the idea from a twisted reading of the hard-rocking Beatles song \"Helter Skelter.\" \n The slayings shocked the country with their savagery. Messages like \"Pigs\" and a misspelled \"Healter Skelter\" were scrawled in the victims' blood on their walls and doors, and the city was paralyzed in fear. Residents of Los Angeles' nearby Laurel Canyon neighborhood, then a haven for musicians, began locking their doors. \n The youngest member of the original Manson Family, Leslie Van Houten, a teenage runaway and former homecoming princess from a Los Angeles suburb, said he had brainwashed her and others with sex, LSD, constant readings from the Bible, repeated playings of the Beatles' \"White Album\" and rambling lectures about triggering a revolution. \n Like other surviving followers who took part in the killings, Van Houten is serving a life sentence for murder. A parole board recommended her release last year but was overruled by Gov. Jerry Brown. \n Another Manson Family member, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, was never charged in the so-called Tate-La Bianca murders but went to prison later for trying to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975. Fromme, whose gun didn't fire, was paroled in 2009 after 34 years behind bars. \n After Manson and his followers were caught, the nation got a front-page look at his piercing, demonic stare and the Nazi swastika he carved into his forehead during his trial. \n The killings -- along with a deadly stabbing in December 1969 at a free concert headlined by the Rolling Stones at the Altamont Speedway outside San Francisco -- contributed to the sense that the era of peace and love that seemed to reach a high point at Woodstock in the summer of 1969 was over, the dream turned into a nightmare. \n But in her book \"The White Album,\" writer Joan Didion indicated people living in Los Angeles at that time shouldn't have been that surprised. \n \"This mystical flirtation with the idea of `sin' -- this sense that it was possible to go `too far,' and that many people were doing it -- was very much with us in Los Angeles in 1968 and 1969,\" she wrote. \"A demented and seductive vortical tension was building in the community. The jitters were setting in.\" \n During a 2013 Rolling Stone interview, Manson had seemingly lost none of his attitude -- \"If I can touch you, I can kill you,\" he told reporter Erik Hedegaard -- but did not appear to be aging well. \n \"He's an old man with a nice head of gray hair but bad hearing, bad lungs, and chipped-and-fractured, prison-dispensed bad dentures,\" Hedegaard wrote, adding that Manson shuffled when he walked and used a cane. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Hashemite kingdom is a key member of a U.S.-led military coalition against Islamic State extremists in neighboring Syria and Iraq, and maintains discreet security ties with Israel. \n Jordan also has a stake in Jerusalem, serving as custodian of Islam's third holiest shrine in the city's eastern sector. \n \n \n \n \n \n Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and annexed it to its capital. The Palestinians want to establish the capital of a future state in the city's eastern sector. Addressing the conflicting claims in the city would be central to any renewed Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the terms of Palestinian statehood. \n Jerusalem looms large in rival Israeli and Palestinian national narratives, and disputes over holy sites there have sparked several rounds of deadly violence over the years. \n Much of the world has not recognized Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem and most countries, including the United States, maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv, Israel's vibrant commercial center and seaside metropolis. \n Momani, the Jordanian minister, said that moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem \"will have catastrophic implications on several levels, including the regional situation.\" He said countries in the region would likely \"think about different things and steps they should take in order to stop this from happening.\" \n \"It will definitely affect the bilateral relationship between countries in the region, including Jordan, and the parties that will be related to such a decision,\" he said. \n Trump said during the presidential campaign that he intended to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. \n Last month, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was quoted as saying that moving the embassy to Jerusalem is a \"very big priority\" for the president-elect. \n Trump's choice for U.S. ambassador in Israel, David Friedman, has said he looks forward to working from Jerusalem.",

When I am president, Russia will respect us far \u2026 \n \u201cmore than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!,\u201d Trump tweeted. \n Trump, during the 2016 White House race, roiled the U.S. intelligence community and others over suggestions that he admired Putin\u2019s tough leadership, despite Russia in 2014 annexing neighboring Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and other strong-arm tactics. \n The president-elect has also suggested that the United States\u2019 stature as a world power has been diminished because of President Obama\u2019s tentative foreign policy. \n On Friday, a declassified U.S. intelligence report accused Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy -- findings made public after officials briefed Trump. \n The report adds fresh fuel to the debate over Russia\u2019s involvement in email hacking that affected Democratic groups during the 2016 race. Trump has publicly questioned the evidence linking Russia. \n And hours before the briefing, Trump called it a \u201cpolitical witch hunt.\u201d \n However, Trump and the intelligence community seemed to find some common ground after the briefing. Both Trump and the report said the Russians did not target vote tallying. \n Trump, in a statement, went a step further and said \u201cthere was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\u201d \n The two other Trump tweets Saturday morning said: \u201cIntelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!\" \n The other was, \u201cOnly reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!\u201d",

The video was captured by the local Detroit TV station  WXYZ .

The boy wandered into the Citgo gas station on West McNichols Road and Conner Street on Detroit's east side.   The temperature at the time he entered the gas station was hovering near 20 degrees.   'He had on some pajamas, kids character pajamas and his socks,' said officer Tinisha Alexander, who arrived at the station after the clerk working at the convenience store saw the boy and notified police.   'And he had a blanket\u2026He wasn't cold, he just kept saying \"I was looking for my mommy\".'   The officer then took the boy by the hand and the two walked through the neighborhood nearby.   That's when a woman was seen running down the street screaming that she was looking for a missing child.   'She was hysterical and crying and scared but then happy that she seen him in the scout car with us,' said Alexander.   Police said the entire incident was an accident.   The boy's mother had woken up and stepped outside the apartment.   Her son also woke up and started searching for his mom.   'He was just looking for his mother,' said Alexander. 'He woke up and his mother wasn't there so he walked out to try to find her.'   The child kept walking until he reached the gas station.   Child Protective Services is looking into the incident.",

Scroll down for video     Video footage obtained by MailOnline shows children and women covered in blood racing from the blast zone.   Another man is seen running away from the smoke on fire.    Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said identification of the dead was being hampered by the fact that some bodies were completely burned in the blast.   Images the scene showed huge clouds of smoke rising from a street filled with debris and twisted metal, which bulldozers were working to clear.    In unverified comments, Turkey's privately-owned Dogan news agency said a car bomb planted by Islamic State was responsible.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the terror group.   Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency cited a doctor in Azaz as saying at least 60 people had been killed and more than 50 wounded.   An Azaz resident who went to the local hospital said he had counted around 30 bodies laid out.   The Britain-based group said six rebels were among the dead, but most were believed to be civilians.       In November, rebels said 25 people - civilians and opposition fighters - were killed in a car bomb attack on a rebel headquarters.   The rebels accused the Islamic State group of being behind that attack.   The jihadist group is present elsewhere in Aleppo province and has sought to advance on Azaz in the past.   In October, at least 17 people were killed in a car bomb attack on a rebel checkpoint, the Observatory said.   The blast comes as a fragile ceasefire is being observed across much of Syria.   The truce negotiated by regime ally Russia and rebel backer Turkey does not include the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.   More than 310,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011.   Nobody has claimed responsibility for the latest attack.   Syria's nearly six-year war has create a patchwork of areas of control across the country, and Azaz is a major stronghold of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA).   The FSA is an alliance of moderate rebel groups whose fighters have, with Turkish military support, pushed Islamic State militants out of the border area.   Saturday's explosion was heard across the border in the Turkish town of Kilis, Dogan said.   Anadolu said 23 wounded people had been taken by ambulance to Kilis hospital, one of whom subsequently died.   In a round-up of its military operations over the last 24 hours in support of rebels in northern Syria, the Turkish military said on Saturday that 21 Islamic State militants had been killed in clashes.   Turkish warplanes destroyed buildings and vehicles in air strikes on 12 Islamic State targets, it said.",

   "7. content": "US mass murderer Charles Manson is now back in prison after he was found to be too weak to undergo surgery after suffering from intestinal bleeding, media reports said on Friday.   The 82-year-old, who is serving nine life sentences for the 1969 grisly killing of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, was reportedly transported from California's Corcoran state prison to a hospital in Bakersfield on Sunday.   The celebrity gossip website  TMZ  said Manson was supposed to undergo surgery on Thursday but doctors determined he was too weak and the procedure too risky.   TMZ said doctors wanted to perform surgery shortly after he was rushed to the hospital but he refused.   When Manson finally agreed to go under the knife on Thursday doctors found his condition was too weak, TMZ said.   California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesperson Terry Thorton said that Manson was back behind bars Saturday morning,  NY Daily News  reported.    Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that went on a killing spree in 1969 in upscale, mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The group hoped to blame the crimes on African Americans and spark what Manson termed a 'Helter Skelter' race war.   He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his 'Manson Family' disciples for having led the killing of seven people -- including director Roman Polanski's wife Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant -- but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison.    Debra Tate, 64, said that as a Catholic, she does not have any 'ill wishes' for the man who killed her sister, but is not allowing herself to 'feel anything' until he dies, The Associated Press reported.    Manson, who was not actually present but ordered the bloody rampage, has been denied parole 12 times and is not eligible to apply again until 2027.   A prison official told AFP that during his more than 40 years behind bars, the cult leader had accumulated well over 100 rules violations, including for assault, possession of a weapon, threatening staff and possessing a cellphone.   'He cannot be described as a model inmate,' said Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.   Thornton said she could not comment on Manson's health condition because of privacy laws.",

Trump raised further concerns in Beijing when he questioned a U.S. policy that since 1979 has recognized Beijing as China's government and maintains only unofficial relations with Taiwan. \n U.S. lawmakers often meet with Taiwanese presidents when they transit through the U.S. -- most recently in June, when Tsai met in Miami with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \n Trump transition spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said in an email Saturday that the president-elect would not be meeting with the Taiwanese leader while she is in the U.S., nor will members of his transition team. \n Trump sounded unaware of the potential trip when he was asked about it on New Year's Eve. \n \"Nobody's ever mentioned that to me,\" he told reporters. \"I'm not meeting with anybody until after Jan. 20, because it's a little bit inappropriate from a protocol standpoint. But we'll see.\" \n Tsai is likely to keep the U.S. stops low-key to avoid further inflaming tensions with China, which has been angered by her refusal to endorse Beijing's concept that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single Chinese nation. \n Beijing says failing to endorse the one-China principle would destabilize relations and hurt peace in the region. In late December, in what Beijing called routine exercises, China's first and only aircraft carrier and a fleet of warships sailed past Taiwan's south, prompting Taipei to deploy fighter jets to monitor the fleet. \n \"I'm confident that both Taiwan and the U.S. want this transit to be low profile,\" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"There is nothing to be gained by irritating Beijing.\" \n In Central America, Tsai will focus on strengthening ties with allies to fend off Beijing's efforts to draw governments away from Taipei and further diminish its global presence. Beijing and Taipei have competed for allies for much of the nearly seven decades since the end of China's civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled across the Taiwan Strait. \n Tsai, who is leading a delegation of 120 people, will meet with most of the four countries' leaders and attend the inauguration of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. She said she would also interact with the heads of state of other countries at the inauguration. \n Beijing has intervened to prevent the island's participation in international forums and established diplomatic relations with former Taipei allies Gambia and Sao Tome and Principe. The moves have been seen as effectively abandoning the unspoken diplomatic truce that lasted eight years under Tsai's China-friendly predecessor. Just 21 countries and governments, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean, now have official ties with Taipei. \n Observers were watching to see if any of the four Central American nations might defect despite Tsai's efforts, but say stronger U.S. support under Trump's administration would help balance future diplomatic losses. \n \"We should expect that in the Trump administration the U.S. would be more vociferous and emphatic about Taiwan's participation in international organizations,\" said Ross Feingold, a Taipei-based senior adviser at D.C. International Advisory, a consulting firm whose chief executive has been consulted by the Trump transition team. \n Although the U.S. does not challenge China's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, Washington remains Taiwan's main source of weapons, with $14 billion in approved arms sales since 2009, and is bound by law to consider threats to the island's security a matter of \"grave concern.\" \n If Beijing aggressively pursues existing Taipei allies, leveraging its growing economic, military and political clout, the competition could prove too expensive for Taipei and prompt Tsai to seek even deeper ties with the U.S. \n \"She may think now that it's America or bust,\" said Sean King, a Taipei-based senior vice president at consulting firm Park Strategies. \"She's probably going to lose these peripheral countries eventually anyway, so why not go for the gusto and get as close to the U.S. while she can?\"",

They organized the attack for December 17, just before Christmas break, as it would be 'the most traumatic' for the community, according to  Denver 7 .    The girls have now been charged as adults as prosecutors on Thursday charged Brooke Higgins with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder.    Higgins wrote that she wished she could have been part of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, and openly discussed her depression and cocaine use.    Everything written by one of the Columbine killers in his journal 'made sense to her', according to the affidavit.   Though the affidavit has now made a number of the case's shocking details public, Johnson posted the disturbing images of her journal to a personal website, where she wrote extensively about her love of 'rebelling' and struggling family life.   A judge set her bond at $1 million after prosecutors argued she was a danger to the community.   Her defense attorney, Dagny Van Der Jagt, argued against the charges and wants the case to be tried in juvenile court.   Higgins and Sienna Johnson were arrested December 12 after police were alerted via a text-a-tip program developed for schools. Prosecutors said they worked together to form plans to attack classmates at Mountain Vista High School in the affluent suburb of Highlands Ranch.   But Van Der Jagt said the teens were not close friends and their cases are different.   'They have very different personalities, backgrounds, interests,' she said after Thursday's hearing.   'They have been linked by what I call very weak circumstantial inferences.'    Juvenile court is a better place for Higgins because it focuses more on treatment and therapy than incarceration, said Van Der Jagt, who told the judge her client struggles with depression.   Prosecutors charged Johnson with the same crimes earlier this month. She also remains jailed on $1 million bond.    They allege Johnson mapped plans for the attack and bought a BB gun for practice. Higgins warned a friend about the plans for the shooting, and a search of her cell phone showed she visited Armslist.com, an online gun site, prosecutors said.   Johnson's public defender, Ara Ohanian, has said the allegations against her have been exaggerated.",

Workers at Harrods' 16 restaurants claim department store bosses keep up to 75 per cent of the service charge on each bill.   They say the current system means staff are missing out on up to \u00a35,000 a year.   Today's protest was held outside the store, which is a popular destination for shoppers and tourists.    The demonstration was organised by trade union United Voices of the World, which represents waiters and kitchen staff at Harrods.   Dozens of protesters turned out to make their feelings clear outside the prestige London landmark, where caviar is served at up to \u00a3200.   It is thought that there are 483 members of kitchen and waiting staff working in the store's restaurants and cafes.   The store was acquired by Qatar Holdings in 2010.   Petros Elia, the UVW general secretary, said: 'Customers expect the service charge to go to staff and that's where it should go. If Harrods feels the need to retain a percentage they should explain why.'   Harrods has said the system for distributing tips is currently under review.   A spokeswoman told MailOnline: ' Harrods currently employs over 450 employees in its 16 restaurants, all of whom are paid fairly and above national living wage.   'Like many businesses in the hospitality sector, Harrods operates a Tronc system on behalf of its restaurant employees. The Tronc system manages the distribution of the service charge only.    'Employees are not required to accept any deduction in their salary in order to participate in the Tronc system.   'Harrods regularly revisits its policies to ensure that we best serve our employees and has been taking steps over recent months to review and improve the current system through which it distributes its service charge.   'We have been engaging with our staff directly on this issue'.",

The mother and daughter died within a day of one another. Carrie Fisher  died December 27 at the age of 60, and her mother Debbie Reynolds the next day at age 84.     A joint funeral was held for the two women at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles on Friday morning as the mother and daughter were laid to rest.   At the private memorial service held on Thursday, celebrities including Meryl Streep, Ellen Barkin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lea Michele, and Ed Begley Jr. were in attendance to pay their respects to the icons.    Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd, 24, broke her silence about their deaths on Monday, posting a photo of herself as a young child with Fisher and Reynolds on Instagram.   She wrote on the post: 'There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby.'    Fisher's ashes were placed in an urn shaped like a Prozac pill due to her love of the item, revealed her brother Todd Fisher in an interview with Entertainment Tonight .    She was open about her battle with bipolar disorder and frequently spoke about the condition in her work.     Todd said: 'Carrie's favorite possession was a giant Prozac pill that she bought many years ago. A big pill. She loved it, and it was in her house, and Billie and I felt it was where she'd want to be.'   He then added: 'We couldn't find anything appropriate. Carrie would like that. It was her favorite thing, and so that's how you do it.   'And so they're together, and they will be together here and in heaven, and we're OK with that.'     A press release about the tribute touched on the accomplishments of the talented actresses.     It said: 'Carrie Fisher wrote and most recently appeared on Broadway in the original solo show 'Wishful Drinking.' Her additional Broadway credits include Agnes of God and Censored Scenes From King Kong.'      It is unknown how or who started the tradition of dimming Broadway's iconic lights.   The theater history book Show Time noted the first time happened in 1957 with the passing of actress Gertrude Lawrence, according to  Playbill .    Deciding whom the lights are dimmed for is determined by ten members of the Broadway League, a trade association of Broadway theater owners and producers.        Other actors and actresses who have had the distinct honor include Robin Williams, Paul Newman, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joan Rivers    When Joan Rivers died in September 2014, the committee reversed its decision and dimmed the lights after an outcry from the theater community",

Scroll down for video    President Jerry Falwell Jr, who is well known as a prominent evangelical leader and an outspoken Trump supporter, told Fox News that the university has used mountain land on the Lynchburg campus for recreational activities which has helped them 'avoid sexual assault problems'.   'We've been able to avoid a lot of the sexual assault problems that you see at a lot of universities by giving students positive alternatives to keep them busy and to keep them entertained.    'The shooting range will be part of that,' Falwell Jr said.    The proposal included a noise ordinance between 10pm and 6am and the site will be monitored 24/7.    The range will also be open to community members and local law enforcement officers to train on site.    The Virginia Department of Transportation had no objections to the plans, and although a local resident alerted the board that there are more than 100 homes near the development site, only four residents complained, according to WSLS 10.   Campbell County supervisor Eric Zeher said the university has done an 'amazing job' of taking safety and noise measurements into account.      Brad Butler, Liberty University's Planning Coordinator, said the wooded area will have to be cleared for the development, according to  ABC 13 WSET .    The campus development will be the first National Rifle Association-supported facility at an American University and will be the first to feature an NCAA certified outdoor shooting range that would accommodate all Olympic shooting sports, according to the proposal.    Liberty University hopes to open the shooting range by Labor Day.     Falwell Jr graduated from Liberty University in 1984 and took over as president after his father, who founded the school in 1971, died.   In  November 2016 , Falwell Jr turned down President-elect Donald Trump's invitation to serve as secretary of education.    He said Trump offered him a four-to-six-year commitment, but that Falwell Jr would not be able to leave his position at the university for more than two years.   Early in 2016 he endorsed Trump during the Republican primaries and said the now president-elect reminded him of his own father.    The university president also came under fire after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting when he said if more 'good people' had guns, they could 'end those Muslims before they walked in killing.'",

'If there's a true stranger rape, a random guy picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones. that person has, like, no moral standards.'   He later told  DNA info  that the spiked trend of date rape and 'hookups' are not something that they are worried about, because they are not true 'stranger' rapes.   People  around the country are taking issue with the police captain's comments, and Mayor de Blasio's office reprimanded him.   Jane Manning, Director of Advocacy at the  National Organization for Women  New York City chapter was among those to make a public statement.    She told DNA info: 'the idea that \"this isn't some guy who's dangerous to women\" that in itself is a major window into the mentality that we're up against.'    She further explained that his comments set a dangerous tone and precedent for officer attitude towards 'acquaintance rapes' and how seriously they should be taken.    Public Advocate Letita James condemned Rose's remarks as well, the  New York Post  reports.    She said: 'Too often victims of rape and sexual crimes do not come forward because of fear that their claims won't be taken seriously, and these comments perpetuate those concerns. '   The women's rights group UltraViolet called for Rose's firing over his remarks that were 'deeply disturbing coming from a police captain'.   Spokesperson Eric Phillips clarified that all sexual assault cases are taken seriously by the police, and that 'rape is rape'.    Rose does not face disciplinary action, and another officer, who wishes to remain unnamed, told the Post that the comments may have been 'misinterpreted or misstated'.    Rose's comments were in response to new data by DNA info that shows sex attacks in the Brooklyn neighborhood Greenpoint have increased 62 per cent in the last year.   The NYPD captain insisted that authorities are not 'too worried' about the trend because only a few were 'true stranger rapes'.    According to police statistics, there were 13 rapes or attempted rapes in the Brooklyn neighborhood in 2016 but only three suspects charged.    Police Officials said unsolved cases are because most were 'acquaintance rape', and women who originally came forward declined to 'cooperate further'.    According to the same DNA info report, only about 14 per cent of rapes nationally are 'stranger rapes'.",

We work closely with the dpi and bond university and actually tag for them.   'We do this so hopefully one day the shark will get recaptured so we can understand how and where the shark travels.'    Mr Ockenfels said that it took him about 50 minutes to wrestle the huge shark and he could not believe how close to home the shark was.   The shark was tagged by Mr Ockenfels for research and then released.   He also said it was not rare to find sharks in the Brisbane River and he had tagged about 50 in September.",

   "7. content": "Electronic cigarettes have been found to damage men's sperm through toxic chemicals in the flavourings.   The latest study to raise health concerns about the fashionable devices found cinnamon-flavoured e-cigarettes in particular make sperm slower swimmers.   Bubblegum flavouring, another of the most popular, kills off cells in the testis which help to produce sperm.   It is well known that cigarettes may damage men's fertility, through DNA damage to the sperm, while e-cigarettes are promoted as a healthy alternative to smoking.   But researchers at University College London found, even when no nicotine is included, e-cigarette flavourings could affect men's chances of starting a family.   It follows research that these flavourings, within the aerosol vapour puffed out by the electronic devices, which can be heated up to 300C, contain cancer-causing chemicals including formaldehyde.   And it comes as scientists at the University of Salford, who found e-cig flavourings like butterscotch and menthol risk lung damage by killing off bronchial cells, call for better safety checks.   The danger to sperm is believed to come from chemicals in the flavourings, which are toxic to the human body, such as coumarin, which is a cheaper version of cinammon bark and commonly found in flavourings sold in the UK and made in China.   Lead author Dr Helen O'Neill, who presented the findings to the British Fertility Conference in Edinburgh yesterday, said the results were 'shocking', adding: 'In terms of motility, progression and concentration of sperm, there was a detrimental effect.'   She added: 'E-cigarettes are promoted as the health alternative to smoking, the healthy thing to do. Vaping is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, but nonetheless they are not without their harmful effects.'   There are 7,000 different flavours of electronic cigarettes, but those tested were the two most popular - cinnamon and bubblegum and plain devices just containing propylene glycol, a tasteless liquid used in the production of vapour.   Sperm samples were taken from 30 men, tested with concentrations of the flavours similar to the average intake for casual and more habitual e-cigarette users.   Researchers found sperm exposed to the highest concentration of flavourings moved significantly more slowly, while their swimming speed was affected. The biggest impact came from the cinnamon flavour.   The men, who were undergoing IVF but had healthy sperm, were not able to use the devices directly, but the flavourings were inserted directly into the sperm in the concentrations they would be exposed to. No nicotine was included.   A second experiment to see how mice exposed to the flavourings reacted found cells in the testes were killed off by the chemicals in them.   Bubblegum had the worst effect, with the highest number of dying cells in the testes tissue.   Dr O' Neill said these chemicals may harm men's fertility through the toxins they produce when heated in e-cigarettes. These e cigarettes can deliver a nicotine hit without containing tobacco and puff out an aerosol vapour.   Many flavourings are only regulated as foodstuffs, based on being consumed rather than inhaled.   Dr O'Neill said: 'There is very little regulation before they are allowed onto the market. Some are classified as food additives and that is how they get round it.'   The study due to be published this month, coincides with a study on e-cigarette flavourings and the risk of lung damage by the University of Salford.   The experts, who published their findings in the journal Science Progress, studied 20 liquid refills in nine flavours - cherry, strawberry, ice-mint, menthol, tobacco, blueberry, vanilla, bubble-gum and butterscotch \u2013 bought from shops, chemists and over the internet.   In laboratory tests on human bronchial cells, all the flavourings were toxic, with the fruit flavours at the lower end of the scale and coffee, butterscotch and tobacco the worst offenders.   Cells did not recover after being exposed for more than 72 hours.   'We are talking about flavours which are normally ingested in food where tissue is much different from tissue in the lungs,' Dr Patricia Ragazzon of the university's Biomedical Research Centre said.   'When inhaled, some of the flavours we tested proved to be substantially toxic, with prolonged exposure killing bronchial cells completely.' She added: 'Our work supports the opinion that e-cigarettes and especially the ingredients of the e-liquid, which can change in structure after the process of heating, have not been thoroughly characterised or evaluated for safety.'",

The 38-year-old was admitted to Dr Sushila Tiwari Government Medical College Hospital, in Haldwani, Uttarakhand, in northern India, on Christmas Day complaining of severe abdominal pains and swelling.   Three days earlier, she said her husband had tortured her for being infertile and threatened to kill her if she told anybody about the ordeal.    Doctors initially attempted to x-ray the suspected abuse victim, but nothing confirmed her injuries.   Eventually a team of five doctors operated and found the rolling pin inside her intestines.   The husband and wife, both from Nepal, had come to the hospital together.    Dr Kedar Singh Shahi, a general surgeon at the hospital, said: \u2018We were very shocked.    'We did not expect anything like this.    'We could only see a shadow in the x-ray as wooden materials cannot be identified.   \u2018The internal damage she suffered was very serious and she could have died.    'The size of the rolling pin was around 40cm long which is a big size to be inserted into a human body.\u2019   The woman was hesitant to explain what had happened, prompting the hospital authorities to inform the police and the National Commission for Women (NCW).   Amita Lokhani, vice-chairperson of NCW, said: \u2018The matter came to me a day after the operation.    'The woman was in a terrible condition when I first visited her.    'She was not only in pain but terrified to speak to anyone.    'I tried asking her what had happened but she did not say a word and kept crying.    'Her husband was present at the time.   \u2018I continued visiting her for three days and eventually she opened up on the third day while her husband was away.   \u2018She told me she was infertile and her husband often tortured her.'         Senior Superintendent Janmejaya Khanduri, of Nainital Police, said the man was on the run charged with rape and grievous bodily harm with a team of officers hunting for him.    The woman is being treated free of cost at the hospital and is likely to be discharged next week and the NCW will continue to counsel her.   Dr Shahi added: \u2018She came to us in a very poor state affected badly with septicemia.    'Her life was in grave danger but she is currently doing well and we\u2019re positive she will make a recovery.    'She\u2019s been a very brave lady.\u2019",

The casino hotel, about six miles south of the Las Vegas strip, was forced to shut parts of the parking garage after the incident.       Court records obtained by the newspaper showed the pair had a history of financial troubles.   Discover Bank filed a complaint against the couple in April, and Emi Yamasaki signed an agreement to make monthly payments of $200 on November 4.   A settlement with the bank was reached, and a judgement of $15,400 was entered against the couple on December 2, according to Clark county District Court records.   Less than two weeks later, their next-door neighbors Gerald and Charlene Parker sued them in small-claims court, alleging they had fallen behind on annual payments of $3,000 the Review Journal reported.   The complaint claimed the Yamasakis owed them $2,400 after $600 was already paid.   The court records also stated: 'Original note for $30,000 was made March 16, 2011 payable in 10 installments of $3,000 due March 16 annually with no interest starting 3/16/12. Four payments have been made.'   The couple had also purchased a home in Sun City Anthem in Henderson, Nevada, in 2005 for about $415,000 - although a filing suggests they were at risk of foreclosure.   The company Quality Loan Service Corp was named a trustee for the couple's mortgage in a filing in September.   The move could indicate foreclosure proceedings, although that is not always the case, the Review Journal reported.   Neighbors told the newspaper they were shocked at the news, saying the couple, who leaves behind a daughter, would smile and wave to them, or gift them bags of peaches from their own tree.

But with proper training, I was eventually able to strengthen myself enough to do this.'   Naseem said he loves making records.    Last year, he smashed 210 walnuts with his head in one minute. He also claims to be a record holder for crushing the highest number of drink cans.   Naseem, who runs a martial arts training school, says he wants to break more records.

Scientists now believe that most large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their cores, with many hidden from view.   Black holes are places where the gravitational pull is so powerful that nothing, not even light, can escape it once inside a certain region, called the event horizon.   They can only be detected from the last gasp emissions of radiation from objects falling into them.   The hidden black holes were spotted by Nasa's NuSTAR, an X-ray telescope.   Researchers from Durham University and the University of Southampton conducted analysis of the NuSTAR.   A black hole is an object whose gravitational pull is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape it once inside a certain region called the event horizon.    As gas and dust (or even entire stars) are sucked in, the material is accelerated and heated to very high temperatures.    This in turn results in the emission of X-ray light.    Black holes containing lots of nearby gas and dust such as the Perseus cluster galaxy produce tremendous amounts of X-ray light.   Ady Annuar, from the University of Durham, said: 'These black holes are relatively close to the Milky Way, but they have remained hidden from us until now.   'They're like monsters hiding under your bed.    'Their recent discoveries certainly call out the question of how many other supermassive black holes we are still missing, even in our nearby universe.'   Daniel Stern, project scientist for NuSTAR at Nasa, said: 'It is exciting to use the power of NuSTAR to get important, unique information on these beasts, even in our cosmic backyard where they can be studied in detail.'",

When fellow  Redditors  pressed for more details, they explained that she hung out with 'snobby entitled rich girls' - while a second added that she was 'obnoxious'.   'In one of my yearbooks, though, she has a page in the back, which I guess is kinda cool,' they wrote.    One Reddit user claimed their mother had known the late Patrick Swayze, and found that he 'always had an ego'.      'I guess he knew he was good [at dancing] and was always a flirt and could be obnoxious,' they wrote. 'But [he] wasn't necessarily a bad person if you asked her.'   They added that their mother was 'really torn up' when the star died from pancreatic cancer in 2009.    Fuzzydrawing's claim to fame was a family friend who had attended high school with Miss Congeliality star Sandra Bullock.   'Apparently she was a total b****,' they wrote. 'Treated everyone as if they were second class citizens not worthy to lick her shoe.'    One poster claimed to have gone to Freedom High School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.   'He was actually a really nice guy when he transferred during Junior Year,' they wrote.   'But then he was just a huge douche to everyone because he made it big on our football team, but he's still true to our tradition, which is to hate [rival high school] Easton.'   Among the Reddit testimonials were also some glowing reports of kind and sweet celebrities who never 'let fame get to them'.    Seraphus said Blake Lively was nothing like her Gossip Girl character at high school.   'I had a few classes with her throughout three years. She was also my TA for one of them. She was pretty cool.    'I always ended up seated next to her so it became kind of a running joke through the years. She seemed down to earth and not stuck up. I dated one of her friends for a couple of months,' they said.     Meanwhile, life in the fastlane999 said his sister in law grew up and went to school with Ryan Gosling.    'She said he was very sweet and kind of shy. Everyone was apparently surprised when he got in The Mickey Mouse Club and was on TV,' the wrote.    Ashton Kutcher was described as 'a super chill guy and a sweetheart' at school by one user who added: 'My aunt has run in to him a few times when he's been back home and he's always been really nice. So that's cool.'    A user called Sharks Everywhere said they were at school with Nicole Kidman in Sydney in the early 1980s.   'She was not in my group but there was a lot of cross over. She was really smart and was semi-famous even before she left school but was ordinary in many ways. It's great she has found international success,' they said.    Another user laid into Jeremy Clarkson, who his father allegedly went to school with.    'In his words, \"he was a tw** then and he's a tw** now,\"' they wrote.   One person said their cousin had attended New York City's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School alongside  Nicky Minaj , writing: 'They almost got into a fight with each other.'    Alpha_lemming claimed to have rubbed shoulders with boxing champion Mayweather who they described as 'academically dumb as a post'.   'You were either in his inner circle or had no idea who this kid was,' they wrote. 'And his inner circle the most hardcore, at a hardcore city school'.    Intriguingly, one anonymous poster described model and actress Emily Ratajkowski as someone who struggled to make friends.          'We shared a bunk bed and dorm room. She was nice, a great artist, kind of valley girl-ish, but pretty down to earth actually, very pretty girl.    'She actually had kind of a tough time making friends within the program, like she wasn't interested in doing so.'   They added that the pin-up had a 'skate rate boyfriend' at the time and said she 'couldn't really decide whether she wanted to pursue modelling or art'.    'Totally weird now that she's a big model and sex icon,' they added.   Pop art icon Andy Warhol, who grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was nicknamed 'The Golden Boy' because he spray-painted his hair and wore head-to-toe gold, according to hippygrandad.       Meanwhile, jazz musician Norah Jones was described as 'shy and introverted' with a former classmate claiming it was 'hysterical' that she is now a global star.   Other stars who found themselves on the receiving end of less than favourable descriptions were noughties heartthrob Chad Michael Murray - labelled a 'douche' - and Rhonda Rousey who was described as 'super cocky'.   Nashville star Hayden Panettiere, meanwhile, was also slammed by Redditor ThatRugReally who wrote: 'My friend was on the episode of \"Malcolm In The Middle\" where Hayden played the babysitter with her. She would pinch my friend to get her to mess up her line.'",

The company is now denying all allegations of wrongdoing in the filed complaint.   Fabletics said Peters was not fired for any physical or mental disability, but that she instead failed to use ordinary care and diligence in the performance of her duties at the company.     Issues first arose after Peters took a three-week medical leave in April of last year, checking into rehab when she admits an Ambien addiction spun out of control.   She claimed she became hooked after she was prescribed the sleeping medication for work-related concerns.   When she reached out to the company, hoping to receive an extension on her medical leave, s he says her colleagues started probing further.   They allegedly attempted to look into her medical information and, according to court documents filed by Peters, even researched the doctor she was being treated by: coming to the faulty conclusion that she was doing illegal drugs.   Peters said she was fired for fabricated reasons on the same day in June that she was scheduled to return to work.     The ex-employee is accusing Hudson\u2019s company of discriminating against her due to her 'disability', and said they unjustly retaliated based on false information they obtained while prying into her medical history.   She is seeking unspecified damages for the termination.    Fabletics is demanding the lawsuit be thrown out entirely, saying they did not violate any duty to her when they let her go from the company.       In court documents, Fabletics stated: 'Defendant denies generally and specifically each and every allegation contained in the Complaint and denies that Plaintiff has suffered any injury or has been damaged in any sum whatsoever.'     Founded in 2013, the company has been commended as 'exemplary' in the past by workplace awareness group Great Place to Work, which gathers reports based on employee statements.     'Please know that we take the welfare of our employees extremely seriously and strive to create a happy and healthy workplace,' a representative for parent company TechStyle Fashion Group told TMZ in October.",

The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple's digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party.   The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone.    The files had been marked 'secret' before they were turned over under the lawsuit.   The documents also make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor.   The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI.   The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau's needs could harm national security.   The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI's sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook's phone.    The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone.   The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI's search for relevant records.    It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest.   In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved.   It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.",

A 24-hour strike by London Underground (LU) workers will leave commuters stranded this week, with staff set to walk out for 24 hours from 6pm on Sunday.    British Airways passengers are also set to endure disruption with cabin crew strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday, while Southern Rail drivers are poised to stage a walk-out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.   Such is the severity of the industrial action on the Tube, that LU bosses have warned they may be forced to close many central London stations in Zone 1.   Last ditch talks over the strikes by Members of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) and the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union ended in despair today as an agreement could not be reached.    Workers are taking industrial action over staffing and ticket office closures - with the strikes set to be the worst endured in more than 20 years.   TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes remained at the Acas building in central London today, making it clear he was determined to continue trying to break the deadlock.   In a message to RMT members, regional organiser John Leach made it clear that the talks had 'failed' and the strike will go ahead.   He said: 'We saw LU face to face and reiterated our position on the key issues of the dispute.   'We demanded that they guarantee the staffing of all station control rooms. We demanded that the current offer of 150 additional jobs be significantly improved and guaranteed to not be lowered under any circumstances.   'LU's response was to repeat their offer of yesterday.   'This is just not acceptable. The unsafe practices and pressure on staff and passengers have to be resisted and will be.'    A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman said: 'We are still in dispute resolution talks at Acas and will remain available for talks throughout the weekend.'   A company source said the RMT left the talks without giving TfL the opportunity to share any further proposals with them.    Drivers' union ASLEF is due to stage three days of Southern Rail strikes on January 10, 11 and 13, plus three more on January 24, 25 and 27.   The Tube strike will begin at 6pm on Sunday evening and continue throughout Monday.   The RMT is balloting its Northern Rail members on Tuesday - potentially paving the way for more strikes later this month.    Meanwhile, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has written to the Chambers of Commerce in the South East asking firms to show 'patience and understanding' to their employees 'during this difficult time'.   Mid Sussex MP Nicholas Soames supported Mr Grayling's message and told the Daily Telegraph: 'I think it's overdue but I'm glad the Secretary of State has done it. I'm sure employers will pay heed to what the Transport Secretary has said.'     Yesterday RMT general secretary Mick Cash claimed  that the LU were yet to offer any 'serious plans' to tackle the union's concerns.     London Mayor Sadiq Khan has condemned the industrial action.   He  said: 'Next week's planned tube strike is unnecessary and will cause misery for millions of Londoners.   'I urge the unions to call it off immediately.'    Announcing the Northern Rail ballot earlier this week, Mr Cash said  Northern staff were being offered 'a below the rate for the job pay deal'.   He said: 'Industrial relations with the firm were already at a low and the latest pay offer shows continued contempt for the workers who run the service and make the company's profits.'   'Our members deserve to paid properly for the work that they do.'   Mr Grayling has demanded Southern Rail workers - being taken out of duty by the RMT and Aslef unions - call off a strike that will close a major commuter next week.   Aslef say driver-only operated trains run by Southern are unsafe - but an independent regulator yesterday said this was not the case.   Mr Grayling  told the BBC: 'Ultimately I don't have the power to force unions to stop striking. I wish I did - but I don't.'   Drivers' union ASLEF is due to stage three days of Southern Rail strikes on January 10, 11 and 13, plus three more on January 24, 25 and 27.    The RMT is balloting its Northern Rail members on Tuesday - potentially paving the way for more strikes later this month.",

Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq war veteran, claimed his bag, went to the bathroom to load his handgun and then started shooting people, killing five and wounding eight.    Santiago was within his rights to carry his gun unloaded in his checked baggage.   The TSA's rules state that a firearm must be unloaded and placed in a locked hard-sided container that completely secures the firearm as checked baggage.   His firearm would have had to have been declared at the counter.    Ammunition may also only go in checked baggage, either in a secure box or in the same hard-sided case as a firearm.   It is the responsibility of the traveler to know specific state regulations in all points of departure and arrival.   And while certain allowances are made for law enforcement officers - and only then under certain conditions - a soldier traveling individually must abide by the same rules.   Santiago was discharged from the National Army Guard for unsatisfactory performance in August 2016.   It is legal for unloaded firearms to be transported, according to rules set out by the Transportation Security Administration.   Unloaded firearms must be locked in a hard-sided container in checked baggage only.   The firearm and ammunition must be declared to the airline at the baggage counter.   Locked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted.   *Source: Transportation Security Administration        Airlines are also free to apply their own particular regulations in addition to the TSA's rules on guns.   Delta - which Santiago was flying on - applies additional rules.   Gun owners must sign a 'Firearms Unloaded' declaration and present guns at check-in.    And, with the exception of handguns, they must go in  locked hard-sided luggage.    Handguns are allowed in unlocked soft-sided luggage provided the luggage has a special tag.   Passengers are allowed to travel with up to four large guns or five handguns.    Delta allows ammunition weighing no more than 11 pounds and it must be in its original packaging or a secure box.",

Kelly came under fire from conservative Fox viewers and Donald Trump supporters during the election for her coverage surrounding the president-elect.    Kelly said in her goodbye: 'Night after night you have welcomed us into your homes for some of the biggest moments in recent history.   'We have tried to live up to the honor of being there.

Part of the appeal of moving to Oakhurst were the outdoor activities available in Yosemite, but because of her weight Diane was unable to make the most of her location.   'I felt miserable and depressed because of my weight. I wasn't active at all and I couldn't do all of the things I wanted to,' she said.    Previous attempts to lose weight failed because when the diet was over she always went back to her old ways.    But she was inspired to seize the moment and change her lifestyle after watching an episode of Castle that highlighted the fragility of life to Diane.   She said: 'One of the medical examiners was telling the lead actress she should follow her dreams.    'He pointed to the corpses and said, \"All those people had dreams, but their time ran out, so don't let that happen to you.\"'   She said it prompted a 'light bulb' moment in which she realized she had dreams that she still wanted to accomplish.    The following day she started eating healthier food and walking on her driveway to the mailbox.   At first she admitted it was a struggle, but after losing 20 pounds she moved on to indoor bike riding and longer walks around her local area.    She also started eating fish - a food that she did not used to like - and once she had lost 50lbs she joined the weight loss group Taking Off Pounds Sensibly for support.    Diane said sugary foods such as candy and ice cream are still 'temptations', adding: 'Staying healthy is a constant, every day decision.'   She said the weight loss has taken decades of her mental age as she urged others: 'Don't put it off'.   She added: 'No-one gets any younger, and the younger you are, the easier it is. I started at 59, which proves anyone can do it.'",

She posted a new picture of Ben on the Find Ben Needham Facebook page, which carried the caption: 'You may think you can hide in the dark forever. No one can hide from their conscience.   'Someone, somewhere, knows something.'   In a message posted at the end of the year, the Needham family wrote to supporters: 'This year has been a very hard and emotionally exhausting year, which would have been so much harder without all of your continued support.'    The family has vowed to 'continue fighting' for Ben.   An eight-week search of the  area where Ben went missing ended in October, and investigators discovered a toy car belonging to the toddler, which was handed to his family.   Detective Inspector John Cousins said he now believed the toddler died in an accident involving a digger.   Speaking about the toy, he said: 'It was an item that Ben was in possession of at the time he disappeared. Kerry was able to confirm this. It was an emotional time for all of us.'    After a search of the site ended last year, Kerry said he hoped Greek digger driver Konstantinos Barkas, also known as Dino, is 'burning in hell'.   The search was launched amid claims Barkas may have been responsible for Ben's death as he was clearing land with an excavator near the spot where the child had been playing on the day he vanished.   He is believed to have died from stomach cancer last year, and Kerry said he had taken secrets to his grave.   After last year's search ended, she said: 'They (police) know he's dead but just can't find him. Police said it's time we ended our 25-year search.    'They are right but I can't say goodbye knowing he's still on that island somewhere. I feel physically sick. I can't feel any worse than I do.   'He didn't leave Kos, he didn't walk away... Somebody didn't take him, so he's here somewhere.'   And she continued: 'Someone knows where he is. For God's sake, help me find him. We know he's dead but we need to find him. When someone dies you find a special place.'   Here is a timeline of events charting the disappearance of Sheffield toddler Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos 25 years ago.   July 24 1991:  Ben Needham vanishes while playing near the grounds of a farmhouse in the Iraklis region of Kos, which his family are renovating. His mother, Kerry Needham, and grandparents raise the alarm with local police and conduct a full search of the area.   July 26 1991:  Eyewitness reports claim a boy matching Ben's description was found at the local airport on the day he disappeared. That boy has never been traced.   September 1991:  The Needham family return to England due to illness but vow to continue the search.   June 2003:  The Metropolitan Police issue an image of what Ben might look like at age 12 - 14 years old.   2004:  An anonymous businessman offers a reward of \u00a3500,000 for information leading to Ben's safe return.   October 2010:  Another public appeal is made by Ben's mother in the run-up to what would be his 21st birthday.   May 2011:  The BBC airs a programme called Missing 2011, which includes a piece on Ben's story and the campaign to find him.   September 2011:  Greek police on Kos officially re-open the case and grant the family a face-to-face meeting with the island's prosecutor.   October 2012:  South Yorkshire Police in Kos begin digging up mounds around the property where Ben went missing to look for his remains.   December 2013:  Ben's mother accuses then-Prime Minister David Cameron of not giving her case the same backing as he gave the parents of Madeline McCann. It comes as a dossier is produced containing reports from eight witnesses, none of who know each other, who all saw a boy possibly matching Ben's description with the same Greek family.   D ecember 2014:  Lawyers representing Ben's family say they may take legal action to try to force the Government to make a decision about funding a new police investigation.   January 2015:  The Home Office agrees to fund a team of British detectives to help search for the toddler.   March/April 2015:  Three generations of Ben Needham's family travel to Greece to follow up a 'strong' lead that a man living there believes he may be the missing Brit due to having no photographs of himself under the age of two and no knowledge of where he was born. The man is later ruled out.   May 2015:  Ben's family make a fresh appeal on Greek television for information regarding the disappearance.   May 2016:  The Sun newspaper publishes a report that members of the police operation go on an 'eight-hour booze-up' in Kos during the latest stage of the investigation.   September 2016:  Ben's family are told to 'prepare for the worst' by detectives leading the investigation, amid the belief the 21-month-old was crushed to death by a digger - the driver of which died in 2015.    It comes as police arrive in Kos to begin excavation work in the belief the boy's remains may be buried near the farmhouse",

Among those gathered to say their final farewell to the two women was Carrie's daughter Billie Lourd, who was accompanied by Taylor Lautner.   Todd Fisher was also there to say goodbye to his mother Debbie and sister, and carried Carrie's ashes in an urn shaped like a Prozac pill.   Carrie was open about her battle with bipolar disorder, and frequently spoke about the condition in her work.   'Carrie's favorite possession was a giant Prozac pill that she bought many years ago. A big pill,' said Todd after the funeral service in an interview with Entertainment Tonight.   'She loved it, and it was in her house, and Billie and I felt it was where she'd want to be.'   He then added: 'We couldn't find anything appropriate. Carrie would like that. It was her favorite thing, and so that's how you do it.   'And so they're together, and they will be together here and in heaven, and we're OK with that.'   Carrie passed away at the age of 60 on December 27, four days after she suffered a heart attack while returning home to Los Angeles from London to celebrate the holidays with her family.   The actress never regained consciousness after being admitted to UCLA Medical center.   Debbie responded to loss of her daughter by writing on Facebook Tuesday: 'Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter. I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.'   Tragedy then struck again a day later when it was reported that Debbie had suffered a stroke, passing away just a few hours later.   'She wanted to be with Carrie,' Todd later told Variety.   Following the service on Friday,  Todd: 'We had a beautiful service. Everyone is as settled as we can be.   'We\u2019ll have a bigger service down the road for the public and all their other friends but this was a private family service. It was fitting.   'We have so much of them that was left behind, all of my sister\u2019s words and all the movies and things they created and that\u2019s what we need to remember.   'My mother was one of the most giving people with charities and my sister, of course, was another of the most giving.   'They were both Molly Browns off sorts. They were very strong women right to the end.'      On Thursday, some of the actresses Hollywood friends gathered at the family's compound in Coldwater Canyon to remember the two women.   Among those in attendance were Meryl Streep, Penny Marshall, Meg Ryan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ellen Barkin and Courtney Love.   Carrie's Star Wars director George Lucas also attended the memorial.   Carrie's daughter Billie spoke at the memorial, telling those in attendance how much she missed her mother and grandmother.   Also speaking were British actor Stephen Fry, Tracey Ullman and Streep, who closed out her eulogy by singing a version of 'Happy Days Are Here Again.'   The Oscar-winning actress grew close to Carrie when she played her in the film version of her semi-autobiographical book 'Postcards from the Edge.'   Richard Dreyfuss, Ed Begley Jr., Buck Henry, and Candice Bergen were also there, as were Carrie's half-sisters Joely and Tricia Leigh and Billie's father Bryan Lourd.",

   "7. content": "The Queen  is expected to make her first appearance at Sandringham today after being struck down with a heavy cold over Christmas.   The 90-year-old monarch broke protocol for the first time ever when she decided not to attend both her traditional Christmas and New Year's church services.   However, it is now believed that the Queen is feeling better and will attend a Sunday service at 11am at St Mary Magdalene Church on her Norfolk Estate.   Buckingham Palace has refused to comment on the rumours and said the Queen's appearance will be confirmed after 9.30am today.   Such was the intensity of her condition over the festive period that the monarch delayed her annual trip to Sandringham for the holidays.   She traveled one day later than planned and used a helicopter rather than a train to shorten the travel time.   Prince Philip, 95, also suffered from the heavy cold but managed to recover enough to attend the service on New Year's Day.   Princess Anne told well-wishers that her mother was feeling 'better' as she attended with her father last Sunday.   Royal sources suggested that the Queen had a persistent 'hacking cough' and was staying away from church as she did not want to disturb other worshippers.    The Palace's last official statement was last Sunday morning when it was confirmed that the Queen would not be attending last week's service.   The statement only said: 'The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold.'    Her prolonged illness has raised some concerns because colds and flus can be dangerous for elderly people.    The Queen has generally been in good health in recent years, although she has cut down somewhat on her traveling and public appearances.    However, signs of the monarch being on the mend were revealed earlier this week when she presented a trusted member of staff with an honour.   It is believed that the Queen was last seen in public on December 1 when she was photographed visiting the Goodenough College for British and international postgraduate students in London.   She also had a string of public engagements in the first two weeks December meeting politicians and diplomats behind closed doors at Buckingham Palace.   The last time she is believed to have been officially photographed was at a ceremony to meet the High Commissioner of Bangladesh and the Ambassador to Liberia on December 9.   The Queen and Philip also attended the private funeral of her cousin and lifelong friend Margaret Rhodes, 91, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park on December 12.   She and Philip are also thought to have hosted their traditional party for Buckingham palace staff on December 20.       The queen invested Ray Wheaton, the Queen's Page of the Chambers, with the insignia of a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, according to the court circular.   The LVO, which is the Queen's personal gift and is bestowed independently of 10 Downing Street, recognises service to the Royal Family and household.   She is also said to be up and about and dealing with her red boxes of official papers.   On Tuesday she sent a message of condolence to the President of Turkey, following the attack in an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Day that killed 39 people.   The Queen said she and Philip were saddened and that their thoughts were with the families of the victims and with the Turkish people.   It has certainly been an eventful week for the elderly monarch, with reports claiming that she was almost shot by one of her own guards while she took a late-night stroll through Buckingham Palace's grounds.   The guard is said to have shouted into the darkness when he spotted a figure walking around Buckingham Palace at 3am, believing it might be an intruder.   But the shadowy suspect was in fact Her Majesty, who had stepped out for some fresh air because she couldn't sleep.   The guard confessed to Her Majesty he had nearly fired his weapon, to which she quipped: 'Next time I'll ring through beforehand so you don't have to shoot me.'",

'It's not something you would choose to do lightly, but that's what our next, and very heroic guest, did to help a fellow mountaineer who had got into trouble.'   And Mr Kay continued: 'Former British serviceman Leslie Binns turned around to save a woman who collapsed while she was on her trip, but he is now attempting to scale the world's highest mountain again.   'He is going back and joins us now in the studio ahead of his next mission.'   But when the camera panned to Professor Landman, the bemused expert said: 'I think you have the wrong guest Sir.'   Mr Kay then asked: 'Do you have any heroic stories to tell us?'   Prof Landman responded: 'I have lots of heroic stories but not involving Everest.'   Both presenters later tweeted about their mistake.   Ms Burden wrote: 'That moment when you're supposed to be talking to a mountaineer, an academic sits down next to you, and you go with it anyway @BBCBreakfast.'   She then posted a photo of herself with mountaineer Leslie Binns and wrote: 'Let the real @BinnsLeslie stand up! @BBCBreakfast.'   Mr Kay wrote: 'OK, so no-one noticed that - We'll carry on. Wrong guest? Wrong story? Nah. The viewers won't guess. Aaaaagh.'   They then went on to interview Mr Binns properly at 9.20am.   In 2006 Guy Goma, a business studies graduate from Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo was accidentally interviewed on BBC News 24 when he was mistaken for technology expert Guy Kewney.   Goma had actually been at BBC Television Centre to be interviewed for a job as a data support cleanser.",

   "7. content": "President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he\u2019ll nominate retired Republican Sen. Dan Coats as national intelligence director -- a post that oversees the entire U.S. intelligence community and each morning delivers the top-secret President\u2019s Daily Brief. \n The Indiana lawmaker served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and was a member of the chamber\u2019s Armed Services Committee. \n \u201cHe will provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration\u2019s ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm,\u201d said Trump, a Republican. \n The announcement comes amid a rift between the incoming president and the so-called U.S. intelligence community, which includes the CIA, FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \n Trump has been wary of announcements by such agencies that Russia tried to influence the outcome of his successful 2016 White House race against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by stealing sensitive emails, then leaking them. \n Trump and his supporters have suggested the reports come with insufficient evidence and are attempts to delegitimize his upset win over Clinton.   \n Trump's announcement came one day after the release of a declassified government report on Russian efforts to influence the presidential election. The report explicitly ties Russian President Vladimir Putin to the meddling and says Russia had a \"clear preference\" for Trump over Clinton. \n The report also predicts Russia isn't done intruding in U.S. politics and policymaking. \n Coats will await Senate confirmation to head the office, created after the Sept. 11 attacks to improve coordination among U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies. \n Coats, if confirmed, would be at the center of the intelligence community that Trump has publicly challenged, to the extent of saying he doesn\u2019t routinely read the daily intelligence brief submitted to him. \n \u201cI will ensure our national security decision-makers have every piece of information they need to protect the American people from the threats facing our nation,\u201d Coats said. \u201cThere is no higher priority than keeping America safe.\" \n South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a defense hawk, said: \"This was a very good choice. ... He\u2019s one of the most mature, knowledgeable and respected voices in the country on all things related to national security.\u201d   \n Trump's team has been examining ways to restructure intelligence agencies as part of an effort to streamline operations and improve efficiency, but Coats' nomination could ease fears that Trump would push for a significant overhaul. \n Coats, 73, served eight years in the House before moving to the Senate in 1989 to take Dan Quayle's place when Quayle became President George H.W. Bush's vice president. He stayed in the Senate until 1998, then left to become a lobbyist. \n After serving as U.S. ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush, Coats joined the international law firm of King & Spalding, helping lead the government affairs division and lobbying for pharmaceutical, defense and energy companies. \n Coats, who earned $600,000 in his final 13 months at King & Spalding, downplayed his lobbying work when he returned to Indiana for a successful Senate comeback bid in 2010. He served one term and did not seek re-election last year. \n Coats was a vocal critic of Russia and pushed the Obama administration to harshly punish Moscow for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. When the White House levied sanctions, the Kremlin responded by banning several lawmakers, including Coats, from traveling to Russia. \n Trump received a briefing Friday from intelligence officials on the classified report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he later told The Associated Press that he \"learned a lot\" from the discussions. But he declined to say whether he accepted the officials' assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf. \n Coats earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science at Wheaton College, in Illinois, before serving in the Army from 1966 to 1968. He later earned a law degree from the University of Indiana. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

'The British picked it up, and we may have had it at about the same time,' a cyber expert who has been briefed on the findings told  The New York Times .   In 2015 a  Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bears reportedly tried to disrupt the UK's general election by targeting every Whitehall server, including the Home Office, Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence, and every major TV broadcaster.      However, the attempt was thwarted by GCHQ.     A declassified version of the report into Russian efforts to influence the US presidential election, released on Friday, explicitly ties  President Vladimir Putin  to the meddling and said Russia had a 'clear preference' for  Trump  in his race against  Hillary Clinton .   The paper, which called Russia's meddling the 'boldest effort yet' to influence a U.S. election, was the most detailed public account to date of Russian efforts to hack the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats, among them Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.   It said that Russian government provided emails to WikiLeaks even though the website's founder, Julian Assange, has repeatedly denied that it got the emails it released from the Russian government.    The report noted that the emails could have been passed through middlemen.   'We assess with high confidence that the GRU (a top Russian intelligence agency) relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks,' the report said.   Russia also used state-funded propaganda and paid 'trolls' to make nasty comments on social media services, the report said.    Moreover, intelligence officials believe that Moscow will apply lessons learned from its activities in the election to put its thumbprint on future elections in the United States and allied nations.   The public report was minus classified details that intelligence officials shared with President Barack Obama on Thursday.    On Saturday it also emerged a  young Russian woman has been placed on a sanction list by the White House for supposedly helping  to interfere in the US election.   Alisa Shevchenko is a skilled hacker employed by big businesses to track down weaknesses in their online security.   Her company was a surprise inclusion on a sanctions list released by the US government last week amid paranoia over alleged Russian meddling in  Donald Trump's  presidential election win.   The only information on the fact sheet said that the company - named ZOR - provided the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence service 'with technical research and development'.   However she hit back at the company's inclusion on the list, claiming she had never knowingly carried out work for the Russian government.   In encrypted emails to The Guardian, the hacker claimed the White House may have been tricked by 'counterfeit in order to frame my company' or had simply 'misinterpreted the facts'.   The news came as Putin attended a Russian Orthodox Christmas service at St George's Monastery in the Novgorod region.    The church celebrates the religious festival following the Julian calendar.        Shevchenko said: 'A young female hacker and her helpless company seems like a perfect pick for that goal. I don't try to hide, I travel a lot, and am a friendly communicative person.   'And most importantly, I don't have any big money, power or connections behind me to shrug off the blame. So really, it could be anyone.'    She also mocked the the 'insane level of hysteria around the entire 'Russian hacking' story'.   Trump has ignored the intelligence report claiming Vladimir Putin influenced the election to help him win.   The president-elect insisted Russian hacking had 'no effect' on the outcome of the race for the White House and dismissed suggestions voting machines had been tampered with.   He made the strongly-worded denial just 10 minutes after he met with intelligence chiefs to discuss meddling by the Kremlin.       Clinton complained during a post-election party in December that Putin had a 'personal beef' against her stemming from her criticism of the elections that brought him to power.",

   "7. content": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2013   Lobster lovers are used to adjusting to high prices, but this winter, they're shelling out even more for the cherished crustaceans because of a lack of catch off of New England and Canada and heavy exports to China. \n Winter is typically a slow season for U.S. lobster fishermen and an active one off Atlantic Canada. But catch is slow in both countries this year, in part because of bad weather, industry sources said. \n And the winter months are also an important time for exports to lobster-crazy China, which celebrates its New Year holiday Jan. 28. It's increasingly popular to celebrate the Chinese New Year with American lobster. That's causing demand at a time when supply is low. \n American consumers who were paying $9 to $11 per pound for a live lobster in September \u2014 already higher than the previous year \u2014 are now sometimes paying upward of $13 per pound. There are enough lobsters to go around, but China's demand is likely to only grow, said Bill Bruns, operations manager at The Lobster Company of Arundel, Maine. \n \"They are building infrastructure to meet more demand,\" Bruns said, who added that China's middle class \"hasn't stopped growing, and they keep eating.\" \n American lobster exports to China have topped 12 million pounds and $85 million in value for three years in a row. The country imported a fraction of that amount as recently as 2010, when it imported less than a million pounds of the crustaceans. \n Meanwhile, prices charged by wholesalers in the U.S. are rising, too. The wholesale price of a 1 \u00bc-pound live hard shell lobster rose about a dollar in the New England market from December to January, when it was $7.75 per pound, according to Urner Barry commodities publishing service. \n The loss of fishing days due to bad weather off Canada has caused a supply issue at a busy time of the year, said market analyst John Sackton, who publishes a website called SeafoodNews.com. \n \"It's become very difficult to get supply and you still have people scrambling to ship lobsters to China for Chinese New Year,\" he said. \n The winter pinch is happening at a time when the U.S. lobster catch, based mostly in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, is booming. U.S. fishermen have caught more than 100 million pounds of lobster for seven years in a row after having never accomplished that feat previously, federal records say. Lobsters were worth a record of more than $600 million at the docks in 2015, records show. \n The slow winter fishing season isn't cause for concern in the grand scheme of things, said David Cousens, a South Thomaston lobstermen who is president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. \n \"Guys offshore are reporting not very much. But I imagine they've probably got enough between Canada and here to fill that market,\" he said.",

No parole. I'm not interested in whether these kids had a tough life, whether their parents loved them enough, I don't care,\u201d Williams said. \n The TV personality called the argument of whether it was indeed a hate crime a \u201cdistraction.\u201d \n FACEBOOK LIVE TORTURE VIDEO PART OF 'THE NEW NORMAL,' CHICAGO'S FORMER TOP COP SAYS \n \u201cThis is the cold blooded torture of an innocent human being. That's bigger than a hate crime, it's bigger than racism,\u201d Williams added. \n Williams offered his prayers to the victim, adding, \u201cIf you can do this to another human being once, you can't be trusted to not do it again.\u201d \n The four suspects accused in the Chicago Facebook Live attack were denied bail on Friday. The Chicago judge they appeared before in court said they are accused of such \"terrible actions.\" \n \n The four suspects were identified as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. \n The beating was captured on cellphone video by one of the assailants and has since been viewed millions of times on social media. The graphic footage shows the suspects taunting the victim with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. \n Prosecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the mother of the victim, who is schizophrenic and has attention-deficit disorder. They also said the beating started in a van when the same attacker became angry that the mother had contacted him asking that her son be allowed to come home. \n A prosecutor told the judge that the suspects forced the victim to drink toilet water, kiss the floor and then allegedly stuffed a sock into his mouth and taped it shut as they bound his hands with a belt. \n Cook County Associate Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked the suspects \"Where was your sense of decency?\" \n \"I find each of you a danger to yourself and society,\" the judge said. \n All four are charged with two counts of committing a hate crime \u2014 one because of the victim's race and the other because of his mental disabilities. \n The uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing. The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But when Wendi Deng, the ex-wife of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was photographed strolling hand-in-hand on a Caribbean beach with Hungarian model Bertold Zahoran it raised more than a few eyebrows.   Not so much their age difference as he is just 21 years old and she is 48 but her choice of a man who is little known outside the fashion industry.   Zahoran, from a small town in Hungary, also happens to be 64 years junior to Deng's former billionaire husband who is one of the most recognisable names in the world.   Deng and Zahoran went public with their romance when a photo of the couple standing together on the island of St Barts was published on his Instagram account - much to the delight of his 24,000 followers.   Scroll down for video    The couple had spent the New Year together along with her two daughters after Zahoran jetted in from spending Christmas with his family in Hungary.   The romance, which began last May, has been the talk of fashion circles and among the power players in New York where Deng lives in a \u00a336m home she received as part of her 2013 divorce settlement from Murdoch.   Dang and Zahoran, who also lives in New York, are thought to have been introduced by friends and were first pictured at a party thrown by supermodel Naomi Campbell.   They later dressed up as ghouls for a Hallowe'en party with the photo appearing on Zahoran's Instagram page.   But while Zahoran continues to grace the covers of glossy magazines and on fashion catwalks in his meteoric rise, MailOnline can reveal he only decided to make a career in fashion two years ago after failing to realise his childhood dream of playing basketball in the American NBA league.   In an exclusive interview his mum, Varga \u2013 who is three years younger than Chinese born Deng \u2013 revealed his dream of emulating his basketball heroes ended when he realised he was not good enough.   'From an early age Bertold wanted to be a basketball player and compete in the NBA league. His heroes were Michael Jordan and other players,' Varga told MailOnline from her home in the town of Mezobereny.   She divorced Zahoran's father when her son was a baby and brought up him and his sister Kitti up on her own.   'When he was about 17 he said he was not strong enough or tall enough to make it in the league,' she said. 'By then modelling opportunities were presenting themselves and he decided to take them.'   Varga said her son was a very good boy: 'He was always very well behaved and was no trouble. From an early age he kept his body in good shape and enjoyed working out.   'Physically he is good looking, but all mothers would say that about their son. I wouldn't say he was very aware about his looks.   'He never thought he would be a model but of course people when they see him in magazines tell me how handsome he is. I am of course very proud.'    Zahoran was 'discovered' in 2014 when he was featured in a photo-spread for Vogues Hommes magazine posing alongside the Danube in Budapest, Hungary, with other local models.   But Mail Online can reveal he was already a seasoned model having started posing for a local photographer from the age of 15.   Hairdresser Tamas Balogh chose Zahoran as his model for a series of hairdressing competitions in the town of Debrecen where he was attending a sports academy.   'He was a natural and I chose him because he had the most wonderful hair and also looked good,' said Balogh.   'Women loved him, but he was not that interested as he was so focussed on sport.'   Putting aside his dream of playing in the NBA two years ago, Zahoran signed to a New York based modelling agency and his career took off at lightening speed.   He has fronted campaigns for Versace and Ralph Lauren and also opened a Givenchy show.   With his chiselled good looks and impressive six-pack abs \u2013 which he shows off in countless shirtless photos on his Instagram page \u2013 Zahoran was a favourite of Donatella Versace.   Despite meeting 48-year-old Deng in May, their romance was not seemingly confirmed until the Caribbean trip.     The sun kissed beaches of St Barts, where the rich and famous see in New Year are a world away from his early life in a small Hungarian town close to the border with Romania.   Such was Zahoran's dedication to basketball that he would spend hours in the garden of his family's modest home in Mezobereny practising shots against a basketball net.   One neighbour said:' Every evening you would hear the thump of the ball on the ground. It went on and on, but Bertold was such a lovely polite boy.'   His first coach Imre Tanczos recalled how Zahoran was a natural for the sport because of his height. In his early teens he was close to 6ft tall \u2013 putting him head and shoulders above other players.   'There was one game where about four of five players jumped on him to get the ball. Suddenly he emerged out of the pile and strode away. It was like something out of a movie.'   Imre, 40, who now runs a restaurant in the town of Mezebereny, said Zahoran had little time for anything apart from basketball.   'When we would go to tournaments in Germany or Slovakia he would be the focus of lots of girls,' he recalled.   'He was a very good looking boy, but had not real interest in having a girlfriend as he was just interested in sport'   At the age of 14, and with his mother's support, he left home to move to the town of Debrecen where he attended a sports academy along with 1,000 of the most talented young sports stars in Hungary.         It was while playing for the Debrecen team that he was selected to represent the under 16 National team.   'People were very proud that someone from the town was representing the country. They would come up to me in the street and congratulate me, said 45-year-old Varga.   'Bertold is known much more for his basketball than his modelling. They do know he is a model, but not so many people approach me to talk about him.'    While attending the Debrecen Sport Academy Zahoran came to the attention of hairdresser Balogh.     'I needed someone to model for me in competitions and Zahoran agreed,' he said.   'What first struck me about him was his piercing blue eyes. He also had a wonderful head of hair that I could work with.    'Other people began to notice him and he was asked to model for other hairdressers.'   'I remember one time he came to the salon just after a basketball match. He had a big red mark on his face and we had to use a lot of make-up to hide it before the competition.'      Since his modelling career took off Zahoran moved to New York and has only been back to his hometown twice in the past year.    Varga, who works part time for a transportation firm, said her son spent Christmas with her before jetting off to St Barts to meet up with Wendi Deng, her two daughters and model Karlie Kloss.   Asked about her son's girlfriend being three years older than her, she said:' That is none of my business. It is his life.'         Varga said she hoped to visit New York to see her son adding: 'Apart from the Christmas holidays he was only here last January. I would love to see him more, but I know he is very busy.'   Among his biggest fan is Donatella Versace. She is reported to have personally chosen him for one of her campaigns.   Runway shows quickly followed and he is a regular for Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Armani.   Photographer Mark Segal believes he gave Zahoran his big break when he featured him in a photo spread for Vogues Hommes magazine in the summer of 2014.   The photos were published the following year and Segal told the magazine : 'I was travelling in Prague when my close friend Cliff Fong texted me to join him in Budapest.   'He mentioned he knew someone starting a modeling agency (WAM models Budapest) there and thought I might want to do some portraits of their guys. I have always been fascinated with Eastern European faces so decided to go and check it out.'    Segal would later shoot Zahoran in the gardens of Millard House in California.          Zahoran candidly admits that he cannot believe his good fortune in going from a small town in Hungary to living in New York City.   He said: \u2018When I started modeling I dreamed about doing big shows like Givenchy, but I never thought that I would open the show in my first season, or ever. When they confirmed the first look on me I was the happiest guy in the world. Dreams do come true. The show was unbelievable; I think I forgot to breathe when I was on the runway.\u2019    His relationship with Deng \u2013 who received a $44m three storey home as part of her 2013 divorce settlement from billionaire Rupert Murdoch \u2013 will also open doors to the cream of New York society.   Deng's romance with the model is her longest lasting relationship since her split with the 85-year-old media mogul.   Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng after 14 years of marriage citing irreconcilable differences.    The split follows reports that he had grown suspicious of his wife's relationship with former Prime Minister Tony Blair - the godfather of their daughter Grace.     According to Vanity Fair, a besotted Miss Deng invited Mr Blair to spend a weekend at the Murdoch family ranch in Carmel, California in October 2012 \u2013 omitting to tell him that her husband would not be there.        Murdoch was said to have felt he had been 'betrayed' by Blair.   The financial arrangements of the split have never been made public but Deng kept the $44m apartment in New York where she lives with daughters Grace, 14 and Chloe, 13.   Since the split she was linked to British classical violinist Charlie Siem in March 2016 at Paris Fashion Week.",

Cardosa turned up on a bicycle around 10am just as the tourists were entering the building.   Images from security cameras, shown on Globo TV, capture the moment the thug surprises the men as he pushes open the glass doors, points the gun and demands their watches, mobile phones and wallets.   During the terrifying ordeal both men, who are believed to be from New York, can be seen putting their possessions on a lobby chair.    But the gun-wielding robber appears agitated and shoots at the tourists nonetheless.   According to the victims the gun misfired each time, as it didn't work properly and the bullets 'left the barrel without any force'.    Mr Bottari said: 'We were going to try to talk to the assailant, but he cocked his revolver and fired four times.    'Luckily, we were not hit. We could have died.'   Mr Ianco is seen on CCTV holding his hand out while trying to talk to the thief and flinching each time the trigger is pulled.   Mr Bottari is captured taking refuge in the lift then darting across the corridor and out through a side door.   A few seconds later he appears in the street at the front of the building and hastily beckons Mr Ianco to join him.   As Mr Ianco exits the building, the gunman, who is wearing red and white shorts, follows and brandishes his weapon before attempting to escape on his bike.   But Mr Ianco, who is a marathon runner, bravely chases after his assailant.    In the scuffle, not seen on camera, Mr Ianco is said to have caught up with the bandit and was hit on the head with the butt of the gun during the fight.   Taxi drivers in the vicinity tried to intervene and the criminal is filmed shortly after the fight, trying to get away while still pointing the gun as people run for cover.   Cabbie, Jos\u00e9 Atico, who was held up by the gunman, said the fight between the American and the suspect lasted just over 30 seconds.   The criminal was caught by cops who happened to be driving past.    Mr Atico said: 'I was standing at the taxi point when Cardosa came up behind me and aimed the gun at the police.   'It was very fast, I just hoped the gun was a toy. I prayed the cops wouldn't shoot.    'An officer came behind him and grabbed his hands.'   As the criminal was pinned down by cops on the steps of a nearby building, Mr Ianco, with blood on his face and shirt, is filmed angrily thumping and stamping on the head of the hoodlum.   Agents pull him away but the American returns to give his assailant another kick.    He is warned off and pushed away by another officer.   According to police both Mr Ianco and Cardosa suffered bruises and minor injuries during their fight and were taken to Miguel Couto Municipal Hospital in G\u00e1vea.   The men were released in the afternoon.   Mr Ianco was filmed arriving at the police station with his white shirt stained with blood.    Shortly after, the accused was brought to the same station for questioning and identification.   According to witnesses, Mr Ianco tried to attack Cardosa again in the police station.    He was restrained and warned to calm down.   The tourist said he had not 'come to Rio to be robbed'.   An inspector responded sharply with 'this happens in many places around the world' and Mr Ianco 'should keep quiet'.   According to detective Valeria Arag\u00e3o, Mr Ianco's reaction was 'disproportionate' and 'deliberate'.    He is said to have sworn and shouted at an officer who was trying to calm him down.   Detective Arag\u00e3o said: 'Joe Ianco's behaviour was not done in the heat of the moment.    'He was deliberately rude, disrespectful as we believe he intended to offend the police officer.'   She added this was something no officer in Brazil would tolerate.   After a few hours behind bars for contempt, Mr Ianco was released late Friday evening.   It is not known whether he will be allowed to leave Brazil until his case is heard by the Special Criminal Court.   The Americans have been in Brazil since Boxing Day and are meant to be returning to the States this Sunday.   The tourists' stolen goods, including two Rolex watches, were recovered and returned.   Cardosa is reported to be a known offender with 13 criminal convictions for various offences, including assault and robbery.",

The FOI explains, the BBC sometimes provides hospitality, equating to about \u00a32 per employee per year, at events like press screenings or to programme guests and, on very exceptional occasions, to some staff.   In 2013, there was a total \u00a324,890.53 spent on wine, \u00a34,508.47 on sparkling, \u00a310,926.85 on beer and cider, and \u00a31,353.17 on spirits.    In 2014, the wine bill rose to \u00a326,653.36 but the sparkling wine bill dropped to \u00a32,430.82. The beer and cider bill was a whopping \u00a315,337.74 and spirits came to \u00a31,310.75, including more than \u00a3300 on gin.    A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has clear policies that drinks may only purchased where there is an appropriate business purpose such as production hospitality for guests and costs have come down by 40 per cent compared to this time last year.'",

Paul Dahlen said Santiago deployed to Iraq in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion. \n The suspect's uncle, Hernan Rivera, told The Record newspaper: \"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good.\" \n In recent years, Santiago had been living in Anchorage, Alaska, his brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press from Puerto Rico. He said his brother's girlfriend had recently called the family to alert them to his treatment. \n Witnesses described a chaotic scene at the airport. \n Panicked passengers ran out of the terminal and spilled onto the tarmac, baggage in hand. Others hid in bathroom stalls or crouched behind cars or anything else they could find as police and paramedics rushed in Friday to help the wounded and establish whether there were any other gunmen. \n Authorities said Santiago, an Army veteran, had complained that the government was controlling his mind. They said he drew a gun from his checked luggage on arrival and opened fire on fellow travelers. \n Bruce Hugon, who had flown in from Indianapolis for a vacation, was at the baggage carousel when he heard four or five pops and saw everyone drop to the ground. He said a woman next to him tried to get up and was shot in the head. \n \"The guy must have been standing over me at one point. I could smell the gunpowder,\" he said. \"I thought I was about to feel a piercing pain or nothing at all because I would have been dead.\" \n The Associated Press contributed to this report",

A Chipotle executive  pleaded guilty to cocaine possession six months after he and many other Manhattan professionals were arrested in a white collar drug bust.   In exchange for pleading guilty in court on Friday, Mark Crumpacker will have his case dismissed if he attends treatment for a year and stays out of trouble, according to the  New York Daily News .    The 53-year-old is the chief of marketing and developing for the Mexican fast-casual chain.    Crumpacker had been named as a customer in a New York cocaine ring indictment and was placed on leave by Chipotle in June.    He returned to work in September as chief creative and development officer, helping lead the chain's efforts to recover from a series of food scares.   Chipotle said it determined none of the alleged activities took place during work time.   Crumpacker's lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said Friday he expects the charge will be dismissed no later than January of next year.    He said Crumpacker has already been getting treatment.   'We're very happy the case will ultimately be dismissed,' Lefcourt said outside the courtroom.    The Manhattan District Attorney's office said Crumpacker also agreed to drug testing.       Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ellen Biben asked Crumpacker if he 'knowingly and unlawfully' had the popular party drug on January 29, as charged in the second count of his indictment.   He paused and answered 'yes' as Biben warned him that to benefit from the deal, he must pass regular drug tests, continue treatment and avoid being rearrested.   Crumpacker, who wore a grey blazer and dark jeans, said he was 'absolutely' glad to put the case behind him.      According to the district attorney, Crumpacker had asked for cocaine to be delivered 13 times to his $2.5 million apartment on West 13th Street near Union Square in Manhattan, and spent $3,000.   He was charged with criminal possession in the seventh degree and bail was set at $10,000 or $4,500 cash back in July.    A Fox Business Network producer and a Cushman & Wakefield employee were among those netted in the investigation. Accused drug peddlers in the operation were also charged.    Crumpacker made just shy of $4.3million in total compensation in 2015 in his role as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at the Mexican fast food chain, receiving roughly $45,000 for housing expenses and over $30,000 for a company car.   Of his total compensation, he received $530,000 as his salary as of 2015.    Judge Edward McLaughlin said to Crumpacker and his lawyer during his first appearance: 'I don't want someone who is a purported bigshot to think they should be treated differently.'    Crumpacker was named Chipotle's first CMO in January 2009, and according to his LinkedIn page he oversees all of the company's marketing functions including advertising, design, events, public relations, social media, and research.   In 2013, Crumpacker was named Chipotle's Chief Development Officer and now leads the company's real estate, design, construction and facilities functions worldwide.   Prior to joining Chipotle, he was the founder, CEO and Creative Director at Sequence, a San Francisco-based branding and interactive agency.   The salaries of Chipotle's top executives were hit earlier this year thanks to a damaging E. Coli outbreak linked to its restaurants. Co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran had their pay cut in half in 2015.    Ells' pay dropped to $13.8m in 2015, down from $28.9 million; while Moran's pay dropped to $13.6 million from $28.1 million. They were awarded no stock.    Crumpacker's salary also took a 20 per cent hit in 2015 from one year prior.",

In fact, those who took shorter naps, longer naps or no naps at all showed decreases in their cognitive skills that were four to six times greater than those taking hour-long naps.     Dr Junxin Li, who led the research, said: 'These people also experienced about the same decline in their mental abilities that a five-year increase in age would be expected to cause.   'Cognitive function was significantly associated with napping. Comparisons showed that moderate nappers had better overall cognition than non-nappers or extended nappers.   'Non-nappers also had significantly poorer cognition than short nappers.'",

The video shows the 23-stone crocodile launching itself at the lying-down zebra in South Luangwa, Zambia.   It appeared that the zebra was very confident of not being caught as it moved its head towards the crocodile before getting up and walking away as it attacked.   The photographer who filmed the attack thought this was because the zebra was exhausted.   He speculated that the zebra was too tired to move after previously shaking off the croc.   The action was filmed by safari guide and wildlife photographer Peter Geraerdts 47, originally from The Hague in the Netherlands.   He said: 'I wasn't there on the first impact of the croc trying to kill the zebra.'   'By the time, I found the situation the zebra was down in a small lagoon. The zebra probably went to drink and got surprised by an ambush of this croc.   'The crocodile has a very strong grip once clamped on a leg or other body part. It will try to drown its prey.    'However, the zebra is very strong and doesn't built up lactic acid as easily as a crocodile, so I believe at one stage the croc must have felt tired and had to let go.   'This is when I found the zebra, exhausted and the croc nearby. Then the croc had a second go for it, but the zebra managed to get away and the best part, but not filmed unfortunately was when the zebra was welcomed by its family, who were standing only 65 feet away from the scene.   'It was rather touching how the greeting ceremony took place.'   Peter said people are always happier to see the prey escaping the predator rather than a gruesome takedown.   'The happy ending situations are always good for people to see,' he said.   'Once animals become a prey to the hunter you sometimes find it that people don't cope that well with bloody situations especially when it's about young animals or big animals because they usually take longer to die.   'This crocodile was a bit too small I would say to take on a zebra but crocs are very opportunistic so if they feel a weakness they will go for it, no matter the size of the animal.'",

Creatures who met unusual ends include a bird shot dead after it knocked over 24,000 dominoes, which had been lined up for a world record attempt.    The latest addition is a catfish which tragically died when a drunken Dutchman tried to swallow it during a heavy drinking session.   The 28-year-old was part of a group which had already ingested several goldfish on a night out, but when this supply ran out, they turned to a more dangerous fish.   Unfortunately for him, catfish put their fins out when they are in danger, and it lodged in his throat, and he spent a week in intensive care.   Curator Kees Moeliker said, Dutch news site  BNR  reports: 'It is a dramatic story. It was an aquarium fish that was swallowed alive by a 28-year-old man from Vlaardingen.    'It was a tradition that had developed among these guys on birthdays.    'First they drink beer, then swallow a fish out of the aquarium. It went well with the goldfish, but when the armored catfish's turn came around, it went dramatically wrong.'   The seven centimetre fish could not be removed from the man's throat, despite efforts by his friends, and it perished in the drama.   'It was no joke,' Mr Moeliker said.   The man agreed for the catfish to go on display, on the condition of anonymity, saying he didn't want 'any trouble with animal rights activists'.    The famous domino sparrow was shot dead in November 2005 at the Dutch Frisian Expo Centre, four days before the year's Domino Day.   Preparations were being made for a world record attempt when the bird flew into the building and knocked over thousands of dominos.   After efforts to remove the bird failed, he was shot, sparking a court case which saw the shooter fined 200 Euros, and the killing sparked huge protests.   It was put on display alongside a mallard duck, which was targeted by another male after it died, becoming the first known victim of homosexual necrophilia in ducks.   Mr Moeliker wrote a 2003 Nobel award winning paper about the incident, and subsequently penned an opera about it, alongside musician Dan Gillingwater.   When the two went on display at the museum a decade ago, Mr Moeliker said: 'The domino sparrow is a symbol of the love the Dutch apparently have for this bird, and we will conserve it just like we did with other birds that tell a story, like the mallard duck that was the first ever recorded victim of homosexual necrophilia.'   The exhibits are also alongside the hedgehog which died with its head inside a McFlurry container.   Following controversy over the packaging, McDonalds changed the cups to make them safer for animals.",

The shops and restaurants in the city's trendy Istiklal Street are all but empty of foreign customers and the hotels in the upscale Nisantasi district are nearly deserted. \n Turkey's economy is suffering in the face of a string of extremist attacks \u2014 including the nightclub massacre of New Year's revelers, most of them foreigners \u2014 and uncertainty following the failed coup in July against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that saw more than 270 people killed. \n Tourism, a key component of the economy as well as a substantial foreign currency earner, has taken a hit \u2014 not least because Russian visitors have stayed away in the wake of a diplomatic spat over Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane in November 2015. \n \"2016 was a lost year for Turkish tourism,\" said Cetin Gurcun, secretary general of Turkey's travel agency association, TURSAB. \n \"It is impossible for Turkey to give up on tourism, but the most important priority of the sector is security,\" Gurcun added. \"The first thing a tourist looks for when choosing a destination is peace and safety. Only then do they research service quality and price.\" \n There was a time when tourism in Turkey was red hot, climbing from 10.5 million visitors in 2000 to 36.2 million people in 2015, making it the sixth-most visited destination in the world. The sector earned $31.5 billion in 2015. But that all came to a halt last year, with a 30 percent drop in visitors, from 34.8 million in the January-November period in 2015 to a little over 24 million for the same period in 2016. \n Yasemin Pirinccioglu, general manager of the VIP Event travel agency, said that foreigners who had visited before were still returning. \"But the people who are planning to come for the first time to Turkey, they're postponing their trips,\" she said. \n Natalia Dubaltsava from war-ravaged eastern Ukraine is among those who come to Istanbul regularly. \n \"We make trips here anyway,\" she said. \"There is unrest in the world. It's a fact. People say the same about our city, Dnepropetrovsk. We are close to the front line, but it is calm there. Life is life. We decided to go anyway.\" \n Because of the economic downturn, the Turkish Lira hit a record low in the first week of 2017, trading around 3.60 per U.S. dollar. Analysts expect it to weaken further in coming months. \n While the weaker currency could have some beneficial economic effects \u2014 making it cheaper to visit or invest in Turkey and helping the country's exports \u2014 the drop makes the country poorer overall and less able to pay its debts. \n The security concerns are obvious in the economic data. In the third quarter of last year, the drop in tourism was the main cause for a 7 percent year-on-year decrease in the sale of goods and services. Consumer spending and investment have also plummeted since the summer. \n Istanbul, the country's most popular tourist destination for foreigners, has been the biggest target for extremists. \n Ten German tourists were killed in a suicide attack in the heart of Istanbul's historic district on January 12, 2016. Other attacks in Istanbul include one in the central Beyoglu neighborhood in March, as well as at the city's main airport in June, where dozens died. \n Hundreds of people eager to wave goodbye to a tumultuous 2016 gathered at the popular Reina nightclub in Istanbul for New Year's celebrations only to become the first victims of 2017 when an Islamic State gunman stormed the premises and killed 39 people, mostly foreigners. \n One statistic stood out in the wake of the tragedy \u2014 most of the victims were from the Middle East. \n \"Before, there were a lot of customers from America and Europe,\" said the club co-owner, Mehmet Kocarslan said. \"Once the Westerners decreased, Middle Easterners became a majority.\" \n \"2016 was a very unfortunate year for Turkey,\" added Kocarslan, who said he was contemplating closing the club after the massacre. \"There hasn't been a hardship our country didn't encounter.\" \n In the sprawling Grand Bazaar \u2014 officially the first ever roofed shopping mall when it was built in the 15th century \u2014 vendors stood in front of their jewelry, clothing and souvenir shops, desperately looking for foreign customers. \n \"Business is quite different than before,\" shop owner Muslim Besenk said. \"There are bombs going off everywhere, why should tourists come? Only Arabs come. The rest cannot come and it's not certain that they will.\" \n Basel Trablesei, a tourist from Lebanon, did not seem worried by the security in Istanbul despite the nightclub attack. \n \"What happened here happens anywhere in the world, so this is something we can't avoid,\" he said. \"I tell everyone to come to Istanbul.\" \n Pinar Kartal Timer, general manager of Istanbul's historic Pera Palas hotel in the lively Beyoglu neighborhood, said the rise in tourists from the Middle East was because of Turkey's greater ties to the region. \n \"It's because already the strategy of the Turkish government has been to make a rapprochement with Middle Eastern countries,\" she said, referring to the conservative leadership that has shifted from its pro-Western policies. \n Barcin Yinanc, a columnist at the English-language Daily News, said that all the strategic advantages Turkey offered in the mid-2000s have now turned against it. \n \"Ironically, all the triggers that helped Turkey fly high in the global market in the mid-2000s \u2014 safety, security, stability and predictability \u2014 have now become big barriers,\" she wrote.",

But the surprise was very nearly ruined when Sam failed to realise he had penned the song himself and continually tried to turn it down, at one point calling him a f***ing d***.'    Jorge, a racing driver, said he decided on the unusual engagement location because he wanted to make their car a place of 'happy memories' after years of squabbling over driving.   'We have a really solid relationship apart from when we're in the car,' he explained.   'She constantly criticises my driving and it really gets to me. I wanted to propose in the car so on future journeys we can think back to the time we got engaged and it will be a place of peace and happy memories.'    Jorge popped the question on December 23 during their journey down to Devon where they would spend Christmas with Sam's family, with their baby boy in the back seat.   As an additional surprise for Sam, an events manager, Jorge's family had flown over from Portugal and were in Devon waiting to congratulate them on their engagement.    'She almost imploded when she saw all the family together,' he added.        Jorge had rehearsed exactly where on the road he needed to start the track in order to time it perfectly to pull into the services, stop the car and get down on one knee.   He wrote the lyrics to the track a year ago whilst working away from home, when he first began to hatch the plan of a surprise proposal.    'I wanted the intro to sound like a generic hip-hop tune and the first verse to tell a love story, so as not to reveal the surprise too early,' he explained.    'The chorus is about our unique love story and the idea was that as the track progressed Sam would gradually realise it was about us and the penny would drop.'   In preparation for the big surprise, Jorge was forced to tell a number of white lies to Sam, with number of 'work' days instead spent in the recording studio, while 'Christmas shopping trips' were actually visits to  ring designer Arabel Lebrusan.   'It was so hard to hide all the plans from Sam,' said Jorge, who described himself as a 'nervous wreck' in the days leading up to the proposal.     Jorge and jointly owns the precision driving company OnQ, and often works with photographers and videographers which meant he was experienced at setting cameras up around the car.   It also meant that seeing recording equipment was completely normal to Sam, who didn't expect a thing.     Jorge considered the exact angle of where the camera needed to be to capture the moment they got out of the car, where he is seen through the back window getting down on one knee.",

   "7. content": "The gunman behind the deadly shooting at Florida's Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport is an Iraq war veteran who had recently become a father and was suffering mental health issues, according to his family.   Esteban Santiago, 26, left five people dead and eight wounded when he opened fire in the airport's baggage claim terminal on Friday.   His family have said Santiago was struggling with psychiatric problems in the lead up to the shooting and had recently been hospitalized for treatment in Anchorage, Alaska.    Santiago had also been charged with domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend in January 2016,  The Daily Beast  reports.    He allegedly verbally abused her in their apartment in Anchorage, Alaska while she was locked in the bathroom. Santiago is accused of then breaking down the door and hitting the woman in the head and strangling her.    Santiago was arrested days later after fleeing the scene but was released on the condition he stayed away from the victim. He was charged with violating the conditions in February 2016 after police found him at his girlfriend's home. The assault case was resolved in March.   His brother Bryan Santiago, who lives in Puerto Rico, said his family got a call in recent months from  Santiago's girlfriend alerting them to his health situation.   He said he didn't know what his brother was being treated for and that they never talked about it over the phone.    The incident that sparked his hospitalization occurred in November when Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage claiming the government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch videos for ISIS, CBS reports.   A law enforcement official said the FBI interviewed him and then called the police, who took him for a mental health evaluation. The FBI said Santiago stated he did not want to harm anyone, but authorities were concerned by his erratic behavior. They said they closed their assessment of him once he was admitted for treatment.    He was also contacted by the FBI after an employer back in Alaska raised concerns about certain things he had said, according to ABC News.    Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico when he was two years old with his mother and brother.   He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before serving with the Puerto Rico National Guard from 2007. He eventually joined the Alaska National guard from 2014 to 2016.   Santiago was deployed to Iraq in 2010 and spent a year there with the 130th Engineer Battalion.    A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before receiving a general discharge for unsatisfactory performance in August last year.   He had been living in Anchorage, Alaska with his girlfriend for two years before they welcomed a child in September last year.   His aunt Maria Ruiz told  NorthJersey.com  that Santiago had returned from Iraq  acting strangely but had seemed happy after the  birth of his child.   But she said something happened to him about a month ago and he was hospitalized for two weeks. She did not have details of his condition.     'Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind. He said he saw things,' she said.   His uncle, Hernan Rivera, said: 'Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good.'   Santiago's brother Bryan Santiago speculated about a motive for the shooting, saying he could have suffered a 'flashback' from his time in Iraq, despite never being diagnosed with PTSD,  NBC  reports.       He said had recently been fighting with people back in Alaska, including his girlfriend who he was having relationship issues with.   He said Santiago, who was 'was pro-America', has not spoken to his family for several weeks, which was unusual.   Law enforcement officials said Santiago flew from Anchorage, Alaska to Minneapolis, St. Paul on Delta flight 1088 on Thursday night. He caught a connecting Delta flight 2182 to Florida on Friday.    A firearm was his only piece of checked luggage.   The motive for the shooting is still not known, but there have been reports Santiago may have gotten into an altercation on his flight earlier that morning.   Santiago - dressed in a Star Wars t-shirt - claimed his bag once he got to Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood.   He went to the bathroom to load his handgun before opening fire in the baggage claim area.   Witnesses said he only stopped firing when he ran out of ammunition, at which point he surrendered to police.   Authorities said Santiago was carrying U.S. military identification at the time.    Police said it looked like Santiago was traveling alone but the investigation is ongoing.",

   "7. content": "NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2013   The division of Cyprus is now in its 43rd year. Next week may mark the decisive moment when the small eastern Mediterranean island nation starts to be stitched back together again. \n After 19 months of talks aimed at reunifying the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south with the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north, the final details of a peace deal are set to be thrashed out, potentially bringing some good news to a region wracked by conflict and distrust. \n But many hurdles remain \u2014 hurdles that have not been cleared in previous reunification attempts. \n The Conference on Cyprus is scheduled to start on Jan. 12 in Geneva, and is intended to hammer out some of the toughest aspects of a peace deal \u2014 including how to ensure security for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots once an aimed-for federation is established. The leaders of Greece, Turkey and the former colonial power Britain \u2014 the so-called guarantors \u2014 are widely anticipated to make an appearance at the summit. \n Making sure there's no repeat of the events of 1974 is key. In the summer of that year, Cyprus was split into two after Turkey invaded in the wake of a Greek-backed coup that aimed to unite the island with the rest of Greece. Following the invasion, the country was cleaved along ethnic lines with the Turkish Cypriots controlling 36.5 percent of Cyprus' land mass backed by more than 35,000 Turkish troops deployed in the north. A Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence is recognized only by Turkey. \n Before the official opening of the summit, Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci have earmarked three days from Jan. 9 to clear up a string of outstanding issues \u2014 including the pivotal matter of how much territory each side will control in a federation. \n Here's a look at where things stand: \n ___ \n MY LAND, YOUR LAND \n Talks almost broke down in November because Anastasiades and Akinci couldn't agree on how much territory the Greek and Turkish federal zones would control. \n The difference was marginal \u2014 just a percentage point. Its impact was immense. \n Greek Cypriots say enough territory must be returned under their control in order to allow at least 90,000 Greek Cypriots displaced by the 1974 invasion to reclaim lost homes and property in a relatively short time. The argument is that an agreement on those lines would reduce the financial burden of a peace deal by limiting the compensation amounts that will have to be paid to those not able to reclaim their homes and land. It would also potentially boost Greek Cypriot support for a deal when it's put to a vote \u2014 a previous peace deal in 2004 was rejected by Greek Cypriots in a referendum. \n Turkish Cypriots, on the other hand, want to limit the numbers that relocate. Telling Turkish Cypriots to leave what they have considered home for decades is unlikely to go down well with many in any subsequent referendum. \n Both Anastasiades and Akinci are expected to produce maps showcasing their intentions. Anastasiades said without maps to sort out a final deal, talks won't move to the top issue \u2014 security. \n ___ \n GUARANTORS \n There's another layer when it comes to Cyprus, an island that's seen its share of big power intrigue through the centuries, from Alexander the Great's invasion in the fourth century B.C., through Roman times, the Crusaders and most recently the British. \n Legally, negotiations that touch on Cyprus' security must include Greece, Turkey and Britain because Cyprus' 1960 constitution accorded them \"guarantor\" status. The idea was to have the three protect the fledgling democracy at its independence from British rule which had followed four years of a guerrilla campaign by Greek Cypriots aimed at unifying the island with Greece \u2014 something the minority Turkish Cypriots deeply opposed. \n Turkey invoked its intervention rights from its status as a guarantor in 1974. \n ___ \n SECURITY \n Trust is therefore essential. \n Turkish Cypriots fear that the majority Greek Cypriots could overwhelm them in the future. That's why they are insisting that Turkish troops should remain as a bulwark. \n Greek Cypriots, meanwhile, have worries over the might of Turkey and insist that a country outside the European Union \u2014 of which Cyprus is a member \u2014 should neither keep troops on the island nor the right to militarily intervene. EU officials have backed that notion. \n Turkey's increasingly authoritarian ways and recent security problems, evidenced further in the New Year's Day attack in Istanbul that killed 39 people, have done little to either assuage Greek Cypriot fears or foster trust. United Nations officials are reportedly trying to work out a formula that would answer the security fears of both sides. \n ___ \n SUMMIT \n Word is that Greece, Britain and Turkey will be represented at the Cyprus Conference at the highest levels. Top EU officials including Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini are said to be going, too. Anastasiades said that U.N. Security Council members may also attend on the sidelines if they so wish. \n U.N. envoy Espen Barth Eide has said the talks may expand to include issues that affect EU-Turkey relations, such as what to do with all the refugees who have fled Syria for Europe. Akinci has said that if a deal is struck in Geneva, it may take a few more months to thrash out the legal details before accord is put to a vote in the summer. \n ___ \n STAKES ARE HIGH \n A peace deal would bolster regional security and ease cooperation in tapping potentially huge oil and gas reserves beneath the Med seabed. \n For the wider region, a deal could be a beacon of hope. \n Greeks and Turks, Muslims and Christians working things out could send a powerful message of peace.",

   "7. content": "To her myriad admirers, it may come as something of a jolt that the vibrant fashion icon Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, hits a milestone 35th birthday on Monday.   For this landmark \u2014 always a tricky one for women \u2014 augurs huge and fundamental changes in her life. And not all of them, I suspect, to her liking.   The first major upheaval will be the departure of Kate and her publicity-shy husband, Prince William, from permanent residence at their ten-bedroom Georgian mansion on the royal Sandringham estate to base themselves in London.   The Queen, who gave them the lease of Anmer Hall, almost certainly has approved of their reclusive lifestyle there.   For she will naturally have recognised that she herself and Prince Philip had only four years of normal married life in which to enjoy the birth and development of their first two children, Charles and Anne, before the sudden death of George VI swept her young family into the pressures of sovereignty.   Thus the Queen will have wished for her grandson and his wife a respite from public life in order to spend time with their two young children.   But a combination of circumstances is forcing the Cambridges, albeit unwillingly, more centrally into the official spotlight.   William\u2019s \u00a340,000-a-year contract to fly emergency helicopters for the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service is expected to end in March. Even if he extends it for several months, it is now certain the family is to move to London this year to take up permanent residence at Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, the former home of Princess Margaret.   The couple\u2019s elder child, Prince George, who will be four in July, attends a Montessori nursery in Norfolk three days a week, but the Cambridges are believed to have put his name down for the \u00a319,620-a-year Wetherby Pre-Prep School in Kensington, West London.   Up to now, the family has made only sporadic use of Kensington Palace, always returning to their beloved Norfolk, although William\u2019s insistence on travelling there by helicopter at a cost of \u00a35,000 a time to the taxpayer has generated criticism.   Although a full-time life in the capital is looming, Kate has never been a London girl. She grew up in a village near Newbury in Berkshire. She became a boarder at the co-educational Marlborough College in Wiltshire, and graduated from the University of St Andrews in Fife.   For three years, and even before their wedding in 2011, Kate and William were my near-neighbours on the romantic Isle of Anglesey, where Flight Lieutenant Wales of 22 Squadron co-piloted his yellow Sea King MK3 helicopter from RAF Valley on search and rescue missions.   From their idyllic rural love nest, a \u00a3750-a-month farmhouse at Bodorgan, they had breathtaking views of the peaks of Snowdonia, and faced the water to Llanddwyn Island, named after St Dwynwen, the Welsh patron saint of lovers.   Kate and I both shopped at the Menai Bridge branch of Waitrose, and I used to see her riding pillion on William\u2019s red and white 180mph Ducati superbike.   I would wind down my car window to wave as they roared by, and looking happy and very much in love, they would laugh and wave back.   But since then, the couple have become much more prickly about their privacy. Understandably, William\u2019s wariness dates from the age of 15, when his mother, Diana, was killed in Paris while being pursued by paparazzi. He insists on complete control of his young family\u2019s public appointments. He is reportedly deaf to all independent counsel.   Indeed, one friend of the Royal Family referred to him as radiating a sense of \u2018entitlement and petulance\u2019, and described Kate as \u2018a little grand\u2019 and \u2018occasionally abrupt\u2019. \u2018They have surrounded themselves with people who say \u201cYes\u201d to everything, so they get no proper advice,\u2019 the same friend added.   Which is no doubt the reason why William, during a visit to the Foreign Office last year, fell into the egregious blunder of delivering a speech that appeared to strongly advocate Britain remaining in the EU, violating the centuries-old convention that the royals never say or do anything which involves politics.   There was further embarrassment when William\u2019s office at Kensington Palace attempted to counter mounting criticism over his lack of public engagements and official work, blaming it on European red tape, and claiming that Civil Aviation Authority rules on rest periods for pilots, handed down from Brussels, meant that William was banned from doing any sort of work on some of his rest days, including \u2014 allegedly \u2014 carrying out royal duties.   It hasn\u2019t helped the couple\u2019s cause, either, that William and Kate were embarrassingly eclipsed by the Queen last year in the number of official royal engagements they carried out. Admittedly, the number rose from the previous year \u2014 following earlier widespread criticism \u2014 but compared with the Queen\u2019s 385 engagements, William did only 204, and Kate performed 115.   Inevitably, their move from Norfolk to London will entail a busier official diary.   Meanwhile, Kate has particular reason to regret losing the peace and privacy of their Norfolk bolt hole. She has confided to friends that she is \u2018really broody\u2019 and would like to try for a third child.   Following the decision of Commonwealth leaders to adopt absolute primogeniture in the British royal succession law, it means that Princess Charlotte could succeed to the throne after Prince George and ahead of any younger children. So Kate has already produced the heir and the spare.   But her own happy family of three children \u2014 herself, Pippa, and James \u2014 is clearly something she would like to replicate. And William may feel the same, knowing that his mother always hoped for two boys and a girl, but never had the daughter she so much wanted.   However, a third pregnancy might not be easy in the second half of her 30s. Of course, doctors point out the risks in pregnancy to women over the age of 35 (from reduced fertility, for example).   But more specifically, during her first two pregnancies, Kate was afflicted by hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness that required hospital treatment. Both times she was compelled to cancel official engagements.   Meanwhile, cruel rumours \u2014 originating in an American gossip magazine \u2014 that Kate is \u2018feeling the pressure of royal life\u2019 and \u2018looking gaunt\u2019, appear to be wicked speculation with no basis in fact.   True, William has appeared without his wife at several of his friends\u2019 weddings, plus there was Kate\u2019s absence from the christening of Mia Tindall the baby daughter of William\u2019s cousin Zara, in 2014, due to her second pregnancy.   Regardless, William and Kate still appear intent on raising George and Charlotte in the manner of the middle-class traditions of the Middleton family, rather than the House of Windsor.   Kate\u2019s mother Carole Middleton is often spotted in sole charge of the children \u2014 accompanied by a discreet detective \u2014 taking them to fairs and other events around her Berkshire home.   Significantly, their appearances with their paternal grandfather, Prince Charles, seem limited.   Once installed permanently at Kensington Palace, William\u2019s royal workload is bound to come under increased scrutiny.   As president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), he has been absent from the organisation\u2019s important events more than he has been present, in sharp contrast to his aunt Anne, the Princess Royal, who, during almost 30 years in the same role, hardly ever missed a single event.   For two years in succession, William did not attend the all-star BAFTA receptions held in his own home, Kensington Palace. Last year, Eddie Redmayne, Penelope Cruz, Cate Blanchett and a host of other stars turned out to find no William to welcome them.   There is another fascinating factor in this royal equation.   Back in London, Kate could also find herself overshadowed by Prince Harry\u2019s beautiful and charismatic new girlfriend, the divorced American actress Meghan Markle.   The last actress to infiltrate the House of Windsor was Koo Stark, and we all know how that ended. In the Eighties, having begun a relationship with Prince Andrew, the uninhibited American actress was seen by many as a breath of fresh air among the fusty Royal Family.   That was until it emerged that her movie career had involved a naked lesbian shower scene. And so the script for this royal love affair swiftly unravelled, with Miss Stark saying later: \u2018In the end, we just ran out of energy. It had been strangled to death.\u2019   If Harry succeeds in marrying Miss Markle, her philanthropic activities could provide Kate with serious competition. The yoga-loving actress is an ambassador for Canadian charity World Vision and has said: \u2018While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, coexist.   \u2018This type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.\u2019   On the other hand, if Harry and his American lover don\u2019t marry and he has to spend more years trying to find a bride, there will be even greater pressure on the Cambridges to satisfy public expectations.   In the meantime, the 20th anniversary in August of Diana\u2019s death will, I fear, act to reinforce the sensitivity felt by both William and Harry about their private lives.   Perhaps they should face up to the responsibilities of their privileged lives and emulate their 95-year-old grandfather, Prince Philip, who once wrote, in a resigned letter to the film and stage star Pat Kirkwood, with whom he was accused of having an extra-marital affair: \u2018Invasion of privacy, invention and false quotations are the bane of our existence.\u2019   For her part, Kate really does stand at the crossroads as she hits the age of 35. Ahead lies the monotony \u2014 and social competitiveness \u2014 of school-runs and the advent of all the increased pressures of middle-age.   Perhaps it is very revealing of her psyche that for someone whose duty is to be in the public eye, she has chosen to shun official photographers and favours taking her own portraits of George and Charlotte.   It betrays an attitude that says she wants to exercise iron control over the image she wishes to present to the world. This change of approach marks a mini-revolution in the development of the Royal Family\u2019s relationship with its public.   William\u2019s great-grandmother, that revered matriarch the Queen Mother, told her daughters: \u2018The work you do is the rent you pay for the room you occupy on earth.\u2019   As much as she is clearly wrestling with her new challenges ahead, when the Duchess of Cambridge takes up residence in Kensington Palace, she will know that the moment has finally arrived for her to come to terms with her destiny as the future Queen Catherine.",

He fired his deputy of 10 years, Joice Mujuru, in 2014 on accusations she was using witchcraft to oust him. In April, four members of the once-loyal war veterans' leadership were axed from the party for calling on Mugabe to step down. \n Mugabe has declared he wants to live until 100 and rule for life. \n Meanwhile, two factions, one associated with Mnangagwa and another with first lady Grace Mugabe, are fighting to position themselves for eventual takeover once Mugabe leaves the scene. \n The mug photos only heightened the jostling. \n \"When pictures not only tell more than a thousand words, but also deepen the power grab narrative!\" posted higher and tertiary education minister Jonathan Moyo on Twitter. \n Moyo, an outspoken minister once critical of Mugabe, is associated with a youth faction linked to the first lady. He often takes to Twitter to attack Mnangagwa. \n Mugabe in December warned his officials against using Twitter to fight succession wars. \n \"Everybody knows that the Boss is Gushungo. One Boss at a time, please,\" Moyo tweeted, calling the drama \"Mug-saga.\" Gushungo is one of Mugabe's family names. \n In defense of the mug, Energy Mutodi, a businessman who appeared with Mnangagwa in one of the photos, responded: \"Everybody is a boss in his or her own house. Every woman who is happily married calls her husband boss, and it doesn't follow that by so doing, women are telling their husbands to overthrow Mugabe.\" \n The state-run Herald newspaper on Thursday said the mug was \"part of the numerous gifts the Acting President received for Christmas and took to his rural home unopened.\" According to the newspaper, a guest arrived uninvited just as Mnangagwa was opening the presents and took a photo. \n For his part, Mnangagwa did not mention the mug in a statement released Wednesday but criticized \"some elements\" for trying to turn Mugabe against him. \n \"Those who are bent on drawing a wedge between me and my leader ... are sure to fail,\" he said.",

Researchers from the  American Chemical Society  said that, at best, all the expectorants and cough suppressants lining pharmacy shelves can offer is a good night\u2019s sleep from drowsiness.   Only cough drops were proven to work, although boiled sweets would have the same throat-soothing effect, the experts said. Honey and lemon has also been found to help children with a cough, but it should only be given from the age of one.   In a video published online , the researchers said: \u2018There is very little evidence that cough syrup is effective at treating coughs and carefully proofed clinical trials show that these medications are generally no better than placebo.\u2019 The cough, cold and sore throat medicines market in Britain is worth more than \u00a3400million a year. Active ingredients include dextromethorphan (DXM), which blocks the cough reflex but can also make you very drowsy.   Both Boots\u2019 Dry Cough and Congestion Relief and Covonia\u2019s Original Bronchial Balsam contain DXM. Also available are expectorants such as guaifenesin \u2013 used in Benylin Mucus Cough Plus Decongestant Syrup \u2013 which are said to loosen mucus in the chest. However, a respected Cochrane Review from 2014 also found \u2018no good evidence for or against\u2019 the use of over-the-counter cough syrups.   John Smith, chief executive of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, which represents over-the-counter medicine manufacturers, said it was difficult to test the efficacy of ingredients because of the different types of cough.   He added: \u2018It\u2019s important to remember that cough medicines will not \u201ccure\u201d a cough.   \u2018If used in accordance with the instructions ... then cough medicines are a safe way to help relieve the symptoms of a cough.\u2019",

   "7. content": "Megyn Kelly\u2018s arrival at NBC could be the final sands through the hourglass for Days of Our Lives.   Cast members on the soap opera were recently informed that the next year of the show will be its final season,  People  reports, just days after the 46-year-old journalist departed Fox News for a position at the Peacock Network.   A source told the magazine that network executives have given strong indicators that the program - which is only renewed through the current year - is on the chopping block: 'Basically, we\u2019ve heard that there won\u2019t be a Days in 2018.'   And this move would not be the only shake-up at NBC.    Scroll below for video    It comes amid reports that Kelly might replace Savannah Guthrie, 45, as co-host on the Today Show.   An insider told the  New York Post : 'There is a rumor on set that Megyn would eventually get the lead anchor role on Today, pushing Savannah out.'    The other co-host is Matt Lauer.       Guthrie returned to the Today Show this morning following maternity leave, surprising Lauer and her co-workers.   Lauer and Guthrie were told just moments before the news Kelly would join NBC became public -  Chuck Todd, anchor of MSNBC's Meet the Press, and Lester Holt, face of NBC Nightly News, were also kept in the dark.      Days of Our Lives, which first aired November 8, 1965, could be in jeopardy after NBC News chairman Andrew Lack mapped out three potential roles for Kelly to fill for the network's news bureau.   They are a Sunday night newsmagazine; a featured spot for special political events; and a daytime news-talk show. The soap's current 1 p.m.- 2 p.m. slot in a majority of the markets could be earmarked for the latter.   NBC's competitors have implemented similar moves in the past, as ABC cancelled iconic soaps All My Children and One Life to Live five years ago to clear space for shows such as The Chew and The Revolution; while CBS shuttered the stalwart Guiding Light in lieu of an updated Let\u2019s Make A Deal program.   Kelly's duties at the network remain largely undefined, the insider told the outlet that 'nobody knows when [she] starts,' and 'nobody knows what she is going to be doing.   'There is so much that has to still be arranged ... she is still under contract at Fox until July, then she has a six-month non-compete' clause to honor.   Kelly - whose chilly dealings with President-elect Donald Trump made headlines throughout the past election cycle - described to the AP the dilemma she faced in her dealings with the reality star-turned-politician, as one of the faces of the conservative Fox News network.   'I really had to choose: Am I going to be an honest journalist?' she said. 'Or am I going to suck up to Trump? I chose the former, and it's worked out fine for me.'   In departing the network, she tweeted she was 'delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge,' adding that she would miss her 'colleagues at Fox.'   Upon inking Kelly to NBC, Lack called his new hire 'an exceptional journalist and news anchor, who has had an extraordinary career' and 'demonstrated tremendous skill and poise.   'And we're lucky to have her.'",

Snask's website says: 'The first batch sold out instantly at the first release party. The 2nd is in the brewery tanks.'   Tunedal explained: 'We did this first batch that wasn't that big. It was mostly for the Swedish market and we wanted to have it for ourselves.   'It sold out so fast. There's quite an interest in it.'   Snask's Creative Director Fredrik \u00d6st told  Bustle : 'Right now it retails for $12 a bottle but we are not sure how it will be priced outside Sweden.   'We have received incredible amounts of interest from all over the world so we are currently looking for distributors outside Scandinavia in order to be able to shower this whole planet with this brew.'",

This weekend's storm is not expected to be quite that severe. \n The closure is expected at least through Sunday. Other parts of the park remain open, but rangers caution visitors to be aware of ice and falling debris on the roads. \n On Friday, rangers stood watch for flooding along the Merced River, a major river flowing through the valley, park spokeswoman Jamie Richards said. \n \"We're prepared,\" she said, adding that they're accustomed to life in a giant canyon with frequent, rain, snow, ice and rock falls. \"We have a lot of things we deal with on a frequent basis.\" \n Rangers are keeping an especially close eye on Pohono Bridge, which crosses the Merced River. Flooding there starts when the water level reaches 10 feet, but the watermark hit just 4 feet Thursday, Richards said. \n Elsewhere, the onslaught of storms sent residents in California and Nevada scrambling to gear up for heavy rain and expecting swollen rivers and toppled trees this weekend. \n On the central coast in Santa Cruz \u2014 where up to a foot of rain could fall in places \u2014 officials have set up sand bag stations for residents. \n \"We're giving them a shovel and the sand and showing them how to fill them up,\" said Jason Hoppin, a Santa Cruz County spokesman. \"We haven't seen rain like this in a long time.\" \n This stormy weather comes as California enters its sixth year of drought. Each storm is welcomed, but officials say several more like this are needed to replenish depleted groundwater supplies. \n The strong wet season began in October with more rain falling than in three decades, mostly in Northern California. Los Angeles is experiencing the wettest winter in six years, forecasters say. \n Forecasters anticipate the storm surge stretching from Hawaii in the Pacific \u2014 called an atmospheric river \u2014 could dump up to 8 inches of rain from Sonoma to Monterey counties. \n The storm's mild temperatures will drive up the snowline to above 9,000 feet throughout the Sierra Nevada, causing runoff in the lower elevations, said Zach Tolby, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno. \n The Truckee River, which flows from Lake Tahoe through Reno, is forecast to rise to its highest point in more than a decade, according to the weather service, which has issued a flood warning. \n Residents and business owners throughout the Reno-Sparks area filled tens of thousands of sandbags. \n Flooding could rival the winter of 2005-2006 that sent 5 feet of water into the Sparks industrial area made up of warehouses and manufacturing plants. Crews worked to secure storage drums filled with hazardous materials to stop them from floating away as they have in past floods. \n \"This is a classic set up for us for flooding,\" Tolby said. \"We're definitely expecting a very wet weekend.\"",

   "7. content": "We do not know if anybody was with Eva Rausing when she died on the morning of May 7, 2012.   What we do know is that the heart of this 48-year-old mother-of-four went into what was revealed by her pacemaker to have been a \u2018non-survivable\u2019 heart rhythm.   The pacemaker had been fitted six years earlier in an operation to repair damage to her heart caused by excessive drug use, but sadly Mrs Rausing had been unable to kill her addiction.   Instead, it killed her. As the coroner reported, her heart failed as \u2018a result of the dependent abuse of drugs\u2019.   What happened next was truly macabre.   At some point that day, her husband discovered her body. A stooped, unshaven and shambling figure, Hans Kristian Rausing was as addicted to drugs as his wife.   Together, while their retinue of staff in the couple\u2019s \u00a370 million house in Cadogan Place in Chelsea, West London, cared for their children, the Rausings would spend days at a time locked away in their vast annexe on the second floor getting high on a noxious mixture of crack cocaine and heroin.   When discovering the body of their spouse, most people would call for an ambulance. But in his drug-befuddled state, Hans Rausing decided to hide it. He piled bed clothes on top of the corpse and, then, when it started to smell, he covered the pile in bin bags.   \u2018I did not feel able to confront the reality of her death,\u2019 Rausing would later tell the police.    \u2018With the benefit of hindsight I think that following her death I did not act rationally.    'I tried to carry on as if her death had not happened and batted away any inquiries about her.\u2019   It would not be until July 9 \u2014 two months after Eva died, and during which time Rausing would even mark his 49th birthday \u2014 that the body of Eva Rausing would be discovered. After having arrested Rausing for driving erratically, and having found a crack pipe and drugs in his car, the police searched his house.   A smell of putrefaction permeated the annexe, and grew almost overpowering in the master bedroom.   It was there that Mrs Rausing was discovered. Her body\u2019s state of decay was so advanced that she could be identified only by the serial number on her pacemaker.   Hans Rausing was arrested and charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body \u2014 an offence that can carry a limitless penalty. He pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, suspended for two years. He was also sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years, for driving when unfit through drugs.   Rausing was lucky. Many would have gone straight to prison.   You might have thought, after such an horrific and sordid episode, that we would have heard the last of Hans Kristian Rausing, who, thanks to being one of the scions of his grandfather\u2019s enormously successful Tetra Pak packaging business, is worth in the region of \u00a35 billion to \u00a36 billion.   Indeed, you might also have thought we would have heard the last of the Rausing family, who have made their homes in Britain since the early Eighties, having escaped their native Sweden\u2019s punitive tax laws.   But then the Rausings are no ordinary family, and the rehabilitation of Hans Kristian and his relations back into the creme de la creme of society proves that leaving the corpse of your wife to rot in your bedroom is no barrier to staying in the social stratosphere.   Just this week, it was reported that Hans Kristian\u2019s cousin, Kirsten Rausing, 64, has been appointed as a deputy lieutenant for Suffolk, where her role will involve assisting with royal visits to the area.   \u2018This is the Queen showing that the Rausings have not been excommunicated,\u2019 a courtier claims.   Make no mistake, being a deputy lieutenant is an honour indeed, and reserved for those perceived \u2014 at least \u2014 to be both great and good.   Previous holders of the post in the county include a whole raft of dukes, lords, baronets, knights and senior Army officers. One of Kirsten Rausing\u2019s fellow deputy lieutenants in Suffolk is no less a figure than Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, the private secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and to Prince Harry.   In addition, over the past four-and-a-half years, Hans Kristian \u2014 who is often called \u2018Hans K\u2019 to differentiate him from Hans, his 90-year-old father \u2014 has been enjoying a very public high-society existence that seems cruelly to forget the gruesome circumstances of the death of the mother of his four children.   Despite being notoriously reticent, Rausing has been seen at all sorts of glittering upper-crust events such as Royal Ascot, and has even had the honour of being publicly introduced to the Duchess of Cambridge at a black-tie gala dinner.   Meanwhile, having sold his house in Cadogan Place, Rausing has bought a vast house on Cheyne Walk in Chelsea \u2014 one of the most prestigious addresses in the capital \u2014 from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for \u00a328 million.   He is now embarking on a vast renovation project that is seeing the house stripped of its oligarch makeover, and restored to its former tasteful glories which would be recognised by its previous owners, who include engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, painter James Whistler and, more recently, Tory politician Paul Channon, whose own family was affected by a drugs tragedy when his 22-year-old daughter, Olivia, died of a drink and drugs overdose in 1986.   So how has Rausing managed to manoeuvre himself from being a criminally convicted crack-addicted widower to acceptance back into high society? After all, his behaviour is more befitting the film Trainspotting than the pages of Tatler.   The answer comes in three parts.   The first lies in the simple matter that Rausing appears to have dried out, and has kicked for good what a judge described as his \u2018utterly destructive\u2019 drug habit.   Rather than cutting a gaunt, twitching figure, Rausing now looks the model of the bulging billionaire, with a well-trimmed beard, rimless specs and impeccably tailored clothes. Although he looks a decade older than his 53 years, he is a far healthier specimen than he was in 2012.   Nevertheless, he does remain almost cripplingly shy in company, perhaps caused by an understand-able wariness of hangers-on. Some have suggested his reticence may stem from his uncomfortable relationship with his father.   In an interview given in 2008, a former employee of the Rausing family, Richard Bezant, recalled how Hans Rausing always seemed frustrated by his son.   \u2018Hans K was a dreamer and a disappointment to his father,\u2019 said Mr Bezant, who claimed unfair dismissal after Hans Rausing sacked him in 2001. \u2018Rausing was a domineering father. He forced Hans Kristian to sit on boards of his family companies. I\u2019d be at meetings when he didn\u2019t say a word. He was as quiet as a mouse.   \u2018Maybe things would be better if Rausing had shown more understanding of his son.\u2019   However, that lack of social confidence may have been somewhat corrected by the second thing that has enabled the restoration of Rausing \u2014 a new wife.   She comes in the form of Julia Delves Broughton, 56, who is the granddaughter of Sir \u2018Jock\u2019 Delves Broughton, who was a member of the infamously louche Happy Valley set of Kenya in the Thirties and Forties, and was tried \u2014 but not convicted \u2014 for the murder of Josslyn Hay, the Earl of Erroll, in 1941.   The new Mrs Rausing is as pukka a piece of Establishment arm candy as a middle-aged billionaire could wish for. A mover and shaker in the art world, Julia Rausing rose from being a secretary to becoming a senior director at the auction house Christie\u2019s, where she first met her husband-to-be in 2002.   The younger sister of the late fashionista Isabella Blow, who committed suicide in May 2007, it was Julia who supported Rausing during and after he went into a private clinic to rehabilitate.   That relationship turned romantic, and in July 2014, just two years after the body of his first wife was found, the couple married quietly at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, with the Earl of Derby giving the bride away.   If the wedding day was discreet, a party held that November at the prestigious venue One Mayfair in central London was anything but.   Assembled to toast the new Mr and Mrs Rausing were aristocrats, arty-types and assorted acolytes.They included TV presenter Jools Holland, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry\u2019s socialite son Otis and his then girlfriend, model Edie Campbell, milliner Philip Treacy, conservationist Desmond Guinness, property tycoon Gerald Ronson, hedge fund manager Rod Barker and his TV presenter partner Tania Bryer \u2014 among others.   It is hard to imagine a greater social advance of fortune in such a short space of time. And it is hard not to conclude that Rausing\u2019s staggering wealth marks the third part of his social rehab. Can money not only buy friends, but ensure they have very short memories?   Hans Rausing is enormously generous with his cash, and it is his munificence that above all cements his place in British high society. Through his Hans K. Rausing Trust, he gives away millions every year to worthy charities. Among them \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 is Action On Addiction, whose patron is the Duchess of Cambridge. It was at an event hosted by the charity in October 2014 that Rausing and his new wife met the Duchess.   But the Duchess is not the only member of the Royal Family who is sympathetic to Rausing\u2019s woes. Another, even more influential, figure is the Prince of Wales, who has often expressed his appreciation of Rausing\u2019s philanthropy.   In July 2006, the Prince publicly thanked Rausing for the donation he had made to the Prince\u2019s Regeneration Trust. \u2018I am delighted to say that we have already attracted some serious support from one very special philanthropist,\u2019 said Prince Charles.   At the time, of course, Eva Rausing was still alive, and she was to receive the backing of the Prince of Wales when she was arrested in 2008 for carrying crack and heroin into the American Embassy in London in her handbag.   The Prince insisted she should be given a \u2018second chance\u2019, and refused to allow her to be struck off as a trustee from one of his charities.   As an aide to Charles said at the time: \u2018The Prince\u2019s charities work with young people, many of whom have had problems with drugs. They aim to give these people a second chance to help them rebuild their lives.   \u2018It would therefore be hypocritical for the Prince not to give Eva Rausing a second chance.\u2019   A figure who was close to both Prince Charles and Eva Rausing explained further: \u2018He knew of her troubled background and began to feel very paternal towards her.\u2019   Naturally, His Royal Highness was said to be \u2018saddened\u2019 when Mrs Rausing died. Although it is not known how close her husband and the Prince have remained over the past few years, it seems likely that they are in touch.   The fall and subsequent redemption of Hans Kristian Rausing is almost like something from an opera, and as it happens, last October, an opera about him and Eva was performed in Sweden.   When it opened, the director, Tomas Isacsson, revealed how he had sent the script to the Rausing family.   \u2018We have not received an answer,\u2019 added Isacsson, sounding somewhat surprised.   If he truly thought Hans Kristian Rausing would welcome such a work, then he knows very little about the protagonist of his opera.   For truly, the likes of Hans K. live in a different world, where it seems, you can get away with anything.",

   "7. content": "The reality star has spoken for the first time of her fears she would die in the October $10million jewelry robbery.   Kim Kardashian  has addressed her horrific ordeal in Paris and her husband  Kanye West 's struggles.   The two events to rock the Kardashian clan last year will be addressed in this season's  Keeping Up With A Kardashians , a teaser trailer released by E! on Friday revealed.   Scroll down for video    The 30 second clip lays bare just how harrowing Kim's ordeal was with the 36-year-old visibly distressed.   As sisters Khloe and Kourtney listen, a distressed Kim sits curled up in a ball on the couch as she recounts what happened that October night when armed gunmen burst into her hotel and robbed her.   Crying, the star - who was bound and thrown in a bathtub - tells her sisters: 'They're going to shoot me in the back. There's no way out.'   So shaken is the mother of two, she said she struggles to even speak about what happened.   'It makes me so upset to think about it.'   But of course just a month later, Kim and her family would be dealt another blow when Kanye West had to go to hospital following a mental breakdown.   In the trailer it cuts to Kim sitting at a table as if about to eat, but is instead distraught as she takes a phone call, learning that her husband has been admitted to the UCLA Medical Center.   It is not clear if she is talking to the rapper or whether it is his trainer Gunnar Peterson who was with Kanye at the time of his breakdown.   'Don't scare me, please. What's going on?' Kim says, crying on the phone.   As her mom Kris Jenner rushes over to find out what is wrong, Kim tells her family, 'I think he really needs me, and I have to get home.'   While Kim and Kanye have faced a very tough end to 2016, her sisters explain that they are all such a strong family that they all struggled in the wake of the events.   Khloe says: 'We're so close, we feel each others' pain.'   Then she continues in a joint voice over with Kourtney: 'Every laugh is louder, every shock has an impact.'   Keeping Up With The Kardashians returns to E! in March.",

The files had been marked \"secret\" before they were turned over under the lawsuit. \n The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. \n The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau's needs could harm national security. \n The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI's sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook's phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. \n The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI's search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. \n In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. \n It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.",

The graphic footage shows the suspects taunting the victim with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. \n Prosecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the mother of the victim, who is schizophrenic and has attention-deficit disorder. They also said the beating started in a van when the same attacker became angry that the mother had contacted him asking that her son be allowed to come home. \n A prosecutor told the judge that the suspects forced the victim to drink toilet water, kiss the floor and then allegedly stuffed a sock into his mouth and taped it shut as they bound his hands with a belt. \n The four are charged with two counts of committing a hate crime \u2014 one because of the victim's race and the other because of his mental disabilities. \n On the video, the male suspects use knives to cut the victim's hair and his sweatshirt. One of the females can be seen laughing. A female also laughs as she punches the victim. \n One of the men pulls the cord from the victim's sweatshirt around the victim's neck and holds him up while the victim groans in pain, according to a document read in court. The victim can be heard screaming when one of the men walks up to him with a knife and asks if he should \"shank\" him. \n At one point, the prosecutor said, someone on the video can be heard saying that he did not care if the victim was schizophrenic. \n The four suspects were identified as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. \n They stood quietly as the prosecutor read the allegations. Some of their relatives also listened, including a woman who wiped tears from her eyes. \n Defense attorneys portrayed the suspects as hardworking, responsible and religious. Cooper, for example, takes care of his twin brother, who is in a wheelchair. Tanishia Covington has two small children. Her sister attends college and has a job. Hill, the judge was told, goes to church with his grandmother. \n All four have experienced brushes with the law, some for serious and violent crimes. \n Hill, for example, was arrested as a juvenile in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers. \n Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped. \n The uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing. The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon. \n The incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential campaign that split the nation. Some conservatives suggested it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection. \n The incident began New Year's Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald's, and then called his parents later to say he was staying with Hill for a sleepover. \n Instead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, police said. \n The victim's parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The victim eventually escaped and a police officer spotted him wandering down a street, bloodied and disoriented.",

   "7. content": "Dylann Roof wore a pair of shoes with racist symbols  drawn on them during trial, an FBI agent testified Friday.   Roof faces the death penalty for killing nine black church members in a racially motivated attack in 2015.    He is representing himself during the sentencing phase of his trial, but so far he has not asked jurors to spare his life or cross-examined any witnesses put forth by prosecutors.   FBI agent Joseph Hamski said that Roof wore the shoes as recently as Monday. When authorities searched Roof's cell in August 2015 as part of a suicide watch, they also found a pair of white slip-on sneakers with a cross associated with white supremacy drawn on them.   Hamski testified about Roof's conversations online before the shootings, where, as user 'LilAryan,' he interacted with others on a white supremacist website. The FBI agent read several passages from a journal found in Roof's cell.    In it, Roof wrote at length about his thoughts on the superiority of the white race and he drew a variety of symbols associated with white supremacy, similar to what was on his shoes.   The symbols, which Hamski described as Celtic crosses, were similar to images that Roof had posed with in selfies before the shooting.     The same jury that last month convicted Roof of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of justice, will soon begin deliberating his fate for the slayings at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church.   Prosecutors have said they plan to wrap up their case on Monday, and the judge said he expects jurors could begin discussions Tuesday.   Roof has said he doesn't plan on calling any witnesses. He addressed jurors directly during his opening statement, insisting he wasn't mentally ill, but he did not ask them to spare his life.    Much of prosecutors' case has focused on testimony from friends and family of the victims, and one of the three survivors of the shooting.    Roof objected to the avalanche of emotional testimony, asking for limits on it or more frequent breaks.    US District Judge Richard Gergel has asked prosecutors to pare down their witness lists, saying he doesn't wish to hamper their case but that he'd like to keep the trial moving along.   On Friday, prosecutors called more relatives of victims of the shooting.   The symbol drawn on Dylann Roof's shoe is believed to be the white supremacist version of the Celtic Cross, which consists of a square cross interlocking with or surrounded by a circle.   It's one of the most commonly used white supremacist symbols dating back to the pre-Christian 'sun cross' or 'wheel cross' in ancient Europe.    Norwegian Nazis used a version of the symbol in the 1930s and 1940s. After World War II, a variety of white supremacist groups and movements adopted the symbol.    Today, this version of the Celtic Cross is used by neo-Nazis, racist skinheads along with the KKK and others.    FBI agent Joseph Hamski testified in court about Roof's conversations online before the shootings, where, as user 'LilAryan,' he interacted with others on a white supremacist website.    The largest white supremacist prison gang in Tennessee calls itself Aryan Nations.    The gang borrowed its title from the older neo-Nazi group of the same name, though the two are separate groups with few connections. The 'gang' Aryan Nations is also far larger than the 'neo-Nazi' Aryan Nations.    The main symbol for this racist prison gang consists of a rounded Celtic Cross image with different symbols in each of the quadrants formed by the circle and the cross.    Source:  Anti-Defamation League       Sharon Risher, church sexton Ethel Lance's oldest daughter, said her mother had her at age 14 and endured hardship and struggle, raising a biracial child in the 1950s and 1960s.   'I know that she had to deal with a lot of guilt and shame, but that didn't stop her because her mission then in life was to make sure that she was able to take care of me,' Risher said.   Walter Jackson Sr, the self-proclaimed 'favorite grandson' of 87-year-old Susie Jackson, said going to Sunday services with his grandmother was an 'all-day thing,' but he wouldn't have been anywhere else.   'I had a cool grandmother,' he said. 'She always encouraged me to be myself.'",

   "7. content": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2013   The horrific beating of a mentally disabled white man in Chicago by four black assailants broadcast on social media is highlighting anti-white hate crimes at a time of increased racial strife in the United States. \n But federal statistics and experts say anti-white incidents remain a smaller percentage of overall hate crimes. Anti-black hate crimes are still the largest number of cases. \n According to the 2015 FBI hate crime statistics, the latest available, there were 613 anti-white-related crimes out of 5,850 total cases. That's around 10.5 percent of all reported hate crimes, and within the yearly average, federal numbers show. \n By comparison, the FBI reports there were 1,745 anti-black hate crimes or about 30 percent of all reported incidents. Jews were the most targeted religious group that year and were victims of 11 percent of all hate crimes. It's not clear how many anti-Jewish hate crime victims also may have been attacked because of their race. \n That data also suggested that blacks and Jews remain disproportionally targets of hate crimes compared to their population as opposed to whites. African-Americans are only 13 percent of the U.S. population, while non-Hispanic whites are 61 percent. \n The FBI defines a hate crime as a \"criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.\" Filing reports for the federal count is voluntary, but guidelines call for reports to be submitted even if they list zero hate crimes. \n Even then, experts say the FBI data on hate crimes isn't a full picture since anti-black cases are skewed lower by the lack of reporting participation by some southern law enforcement agencies. \n Some large Florida cities, like Miami, reported no hate crimes to the FBI in 2015, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University. \"I doubt that cities as diverse as those had no hate crimes,\" he said. \n In Chicago, two men and two women \u2014 all black \u2014 are facing hate crime charges in connection with the brutal beating of a mentally disabled white man that was streamed on Facebook Live. The video shows the victim is tied up and the suspects are making racial slurs and references to his mental capacity, Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said. \n The suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt. \n The 18-year-old victim, who is from a Chicago suburb, suffers from schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder, authorities said. \n The victim also was taunted with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. \n Eighteen-year-olds Brittany Covington, Tesfaye Cooper and Jordan Hill, and 24-year-old Tanishia Covington also face kidnapping and battery charges in connection with the attack. \n The case heightened political tensions on social media and opened yet-to-be healed wounds from a nasty presidential election campaign. Some conservatives suggested the attack highlighted growing anti-white violence and was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, although police said there was no indication of any connection. \n The FBI does classify attacks based on disability as a hate crime. Federal numbers show 88 incidents related to attacks on disability in 2015. \n In addition to underreporting, Levin said strong federal data of the race and ethnicity of assailants is incomplete because of the lack of consistent reporting. \n The 2015 FBI data showed that of the 734 total reported offenses committed against whites \u2014 a single incident could have multiple offenses like assault or theft \u2014 46 percent of those were committed by blacks. \n In contrast, of the 2,125 reported offenses committed against blacks, 58 percent of those who committed by whites. \n Still, despite the data, Levin said the Chicago beating is resonating because it was shown via social media and racial relations are tense following the November election. Live streams and 140 Twitter characters inflame the fires. \n Levin described the situation as \"a logjam of motivations\" for conflict, saying it's like nothing he's ever seen. \n \"We are seeing the coarseness that exists in society generally, those embers, have crossed the fire lines to all parts of the racial, ethnic and ideological spectrum,\" Levin said. \n ___ \n Associated Press writer Christina A.

   "7. content": "Since Sears bought the trademark in 1927, Craftsman tools have had a famous lifetime - and unlimited - warranty.    But after nearly 90 years, Sears announced Thursday that it's selling the Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc for $900 million that bosses hope will keep the company afloat.    The change of hands has caused some to question whether Craftsman's lifetime warranty will still apply to tools people own now or purchase in the future.    'Best part is the lifetime warranty. Break a tool, bring it to Sears, get a brand new one, no charge or backtalk. Virtually everyone in our shop feels the same way. They all also use Craftsman,\" electrical design engineer Mike wrote to  Consumerist .    Stanley Black & Decker spokesman Tim Perra answered yes, hinting at some possible changes.    'Today, Craftsman's warranties vary by business and product lines, and in some cases are very similar to Stanley Black & Decker's existing lifetime guarantee policies on certain product lines', Perra said.    'It is too early to speculate on the specifics, but we would expect that to continue and we are always committed to doing the right thing to support the brand and our end-users'.    Craftsman's lifetime warranty only applies to hand tools and not to items that can wear out over normal use, such as saw blades.   The company's warranty has lost its luster in the past decade, with some stores setting quotas on the number of items that can be exchanged.    An updated version of the warranty in 2014 further eroded the company's reputation by noting that tools must be returned to the store 'from which it was purchased'.    Sears will continue to sell Craftsman products for 15 years at its Kmart and namesake stores until an undisclosed time.    After that period, the former retail giant will pay three percent of royalties to Stanley Black & Decker.   Stanley, which makes and sells tools under the DeWalt and Black & Decker names, wants to grow the Craftsman brand by selling its products in more stores outside of Sears.   Today, only 10 percent of Craftsman products are sold in other stores.",

   "7. content": "If the statistics are correct, many millions of new runners have laced up for the first time in the last few days.    If you are one of them, then, as I've written elsewhere, you are well on your way to being faster, stronger, more resilient, more intelligent and more empathetic than when you awoke on New Year's Day nursing little more than a hangover and a firm resolution.    So, with such great rewards in the pipeline, why do millions of us fail in those first critical weeks? It's because, for the body, the first month of new training is so booby-trapped that Lara Croft would find the obstacles tricky to negotiate.    Read on and you might just make it safely to February, and beyond.   On your very first run your body will have become suddenly aware that it needs to remodel to match its new training loads.    Our muscular system responds to training easily, and can repair and rebuild in a matter of days. And, because the heart and lungs are part of this system they too will improve rapidly.    After just a few runs, the cardio-respiratory system will become more efficient making you feel fitter and stronger.    And this is at the core of where most new runners get into trouble.    The tragedy is that other soft structures, connective tissues like tendons and ligaments, are just as weak as when you stepped out for your very first run.    They are slower to repair and remodel than muscles, and about ten days in to your new regime, they will probably have completed the adaptation from only your first run.   The Goldilocks Threshold   For training to work effectively, soft tissues have to be strained and slightly damaged to what I'm going to call a Goldilocks Threshold. If soft tissues are not stressed by training, they will not adapt at all (but this is never the case for new runners).    If they are too stressed (almost always the case for new runners) then you will only be as strong as your weakest link, and wherever that is, that will be the first thing to go.   In the first few weeks of a new exercise regime, you need to bear in mind that your tendons and ligaments are at least ten to 14 days behind how strong you might be feeling on any given day.   And if you've been careful, and made it through the first fortnight without imposing too many new demands on tendons that are still struggling to adapt, there is another process that is even slower.   Ever since the 19th century, we have had Wolff's Law to tell us that our bones adapt over time to increased loading. Imposing new demands on bones stimulates them to remodel.    Called mechanotransduction, bones convert the physical indicators of the forces and stresses placed upon them into chemical ones that stimulate the bones to repair, first by breaking down their existing structures and then by rebuilding stronger ones.    But this is a much slower process than with soft and connective tissues.   While it may be surprising to learn that two weeks into your new training schedule your bones are basically still those of a non-runner, the news is actually worse than this.    Bone remodeling requires that some of the structure is destroyed (by a cell called an osteoclast) before it can be rebuilt.    So, during your third week of running, feeling fitter and stronger, with some soft tissue adaptation beginning to take place, your bones are for a short period actually weaker than when you first started.    By the fourth week, your bones will have succeeded to adapting to your first week's run and so will be a little stronger.    But they are always going to be a few weeks behind because contrary to popular belief running is very good for our bones, but density adaptation is comparatively slow.   With these processes in a constant and unsynchronised cycle, the new jogger has to be vigilant in not running away with their new-found fitness straight into a stress fracture.    If you have just taken up running it is worth thinking about the Goldilocks Threshold, and remember that no one has ever given up or got injured because they did too little.    The clearest feedback that your body gives you while running is that of your immediate cardio-respiratory experience.    And for every run you do, this will improve, but you must avoid entirely the idea that cardio-respiratory ability is an indicator of your overall fitness \u2013 it isn't. It is only the tiniest tip of the iceberg of what is going on in the body.   While you're just hitting your stride, your body is punishingly hard at work doing some miraculous things under your skin to adapt to your change of lifestyle.   So be kind to yourself, take it slow, enjoy it, give your body the time and space that it needs, and you will be much more likely to make it to February.

Officials also plan to set up the nearby industrial zone where Chinese companies will be invited to set up factories. \n The violence erupted in Amabalantota, some 22 kilometers (13 miles) from the port city of Hambantota, when villagers and monks marched near the opening ceremony demanding their residential and farm lands be spared. \n It was unclear if anyone was injured. A court has issued a restraining order on the protest, saying it could lead to unrest. \n China invested over $1.2 billion in the port in what some analysts call its \"string of pearls\" strategy in countries surrounding its rival India. Although the project made losses since 2010, Sri Lanka's government, at first critical of the enterprise, approached China seeking help to make it viable. \n Lawmaker D.V. Chanaka, one of the protest organizers, said he fears the port area will become a \"Chinese colony.\" He said more than 10,000 people including 3,000 monks were expected at the protest. \n Police commandos patrolled the streets of Hambantota, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of capital Colombo, set up roadblocks and stationed water cannons. \n \n More on this... \n \n \n \n \n Police brace for Sri Lanka rally against port lease to China \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Taiwan protests Vietnam deporting fraud suspects to China \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"We are against leasing the lands where people live and do their farming, while there are identified lands for an industrial zone,\" said Chanaka, the district lawmaker. \"When you give away such a vast area of land you can't stop the area becoming a Chinese colony.\" \n After the lease expires, it can be negotiated for another 99 years, according to the framework agreement, whose terms are still being negotiated. The government also has proposed to lease another 15,000 acres (6,070 hectares) in Hambantota district and adjoining Moneragala district for an industrial zone. \n The Rev. Magama Mahanama, from an organization calling itself the Monks' Organization to Protect National Assets, said that the clergy following an ancient tradition would issue a decree to the government to stop the leasing. Historically, kings in predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka are said to have abided by decrees issued by Buddhist monks. \n \"It's a way of conveying the message that the monks are not for it,\" Mahanama said. \"Ninety-nine years means at least two generations. When they (the Chinese) take root here, what's the guarantee that we will have it back? There is a major threat of cultural erosion and demographic change.\" \n Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, speaking to reporters earlier this week, said the partnership arrangement was necessary to free the country from the debt incurred to build the port. He blamed the debt on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose government was friendly to Beijing. \n He said the industrial zone was necessary to make the port and the nearby Chinese-financed airport, also running at a heavy loss, viable. \n \"The port can't be taken away,\" he said, adding that the former British colonial rulers did not take away the Trincomalee harbor, Sri Lanka's airport or the Colombo port.",

Equally, those given narrow cups expected their drinks to be more bitter than those in wider containers.   The shape of the mug also influenced the amount that participants were willing to pay for their hot drink \u2013 with customers shelling out more for wider, taller mugs.   Over 300 volunteers from China, Colombia and the UK were asked to rate eight coffee mugs of varying diameters on fragrance, bitterness, taste, and temperature.   The study, co-authored by Dr Andy Woods of Crossmodal Research Laboratory, Oxford University, aimed to ascertain whether expectations about coffee are influenced by changes in the shape of the mug.   The results revealed that the cup diameter and height \u2018influenced the expected aroma, bitterness [and] intensity\u2019 as well as how much the buyer is willing to pay for it.   They discovered that coffee in wider diameter mugs was \u2018expected to be sweeter\u2019 than drinks in thinner cups.   The volunteers were almost equally divided among the sexes and aged from 17 to 60-years-old.   They were asked to rate the mugs in order of how strong smelling, how bitter, intense, and sweet they would expect the coffee from each to be.   Participants were also questioned how hot, energising, likeable, and expensive the drinks would be.   The results showed: \u2018The coffee associated with short mugs was expected to be more bitter than the coffee associated with taller mugs.   \u2018There was also a significant main effect of \u2018cup diameter\u2019, with narrower diameter mugs thought to be more bitter than the coffee associated with wider diameter mugs.   \u2018The coffee from mugs with a wider diameter [was] expected to be sweeter than coffee from mugs with a narrower diameter.\u2019   Overall the Chinese preferred short mugs, while Colmobians and Britons preferred taller. Unsurprisingly all participants were willing to pay more for bigger cups.   Interestingly those from the UK expected the mugs to be hotter than participants from either China or Colombia, which experts suggested could be down to cooler weather.   Writing in the journal Food Quality and Preference, the authors said the bitterness factor might be down to \u2018people expect the ratio of coffee to milk, or water, in the shorter mugs to be greater than they expect the ratio to be in taller mugs, and thus expect the coffee in shorter mugs to be more bitter.\u2019   Differences in choice of width might be explained because: \u2018people expect the ratio of coffee to milk, or water, in the wider diameter mugs to be less than it is in narrower mugs, and thus expect the drink to be less bitter, or sweeter.\u2019   Narrow or shorter mugs allowed less aroma to escape it was suggested.   They concluded: \u2018The shape of the mug influenced people\u2019s expectations of the taste and qualities of coffee that would be served in such a mug.   \u2018Shape, or more likely \u201cvolume\u201d, also influenced the amount participants were willing-to-pay for a coffee. If caf\u00e9 owners, baristas, and crockery manufacturers want to manipulate people\u2019s expectations of coffee, they should carefully consider the diameter and height of the cups they use.\u2019",

We need to address all of the causes of that. The Government is not obsessed by Brexit \u2013 we are committed to delivering real social reform. Everything we are doing, including Brexit, is part of that.\u2019   Mrs May is expected to restate her commitment to grammar schools, despite opposition from the education establishment.   She will also pledge to deliver a new wave of housebuilding, despite concerns from some Tory MPs about the potential impact on the countryside. The Prime Minister will argue it is unacceptable for young people to face a situation where it is \u2018harder than ever before to own your own home\u2019.   Communities Secretary Sajid Javid yesterday hinted at plans for a wave of prefabricated housing to ease the logjam in construction.   Later this month he will publish proposals to speed up the planning process and force councils to accept thousands more homes in a bid to ease the housing crisis.   Mrs May is said to be pushing him to ensure that new housing is not restricted to the South East, but also spread to other parts of the country where the Government\u2019s forthcoming industrial strategy is designed to boost jobs and economic growth.   The PM has also raised repeated concerns about health inequalities that mean those born in the poorest areas have an average life expectancy nine years shorter than those born in the wealthiest places.   Sources confirmed Mrs May\u2019s speech will include a big push on mental health, where she has previously said there is \u2018not enough help to hand\u2019. She developed an interest in mental illness and its consequences during her time as home secretary.   She was struck by how much police time is taken up with the issue as well as the prevalence of serious mental health conditions among prison inmates.   Proposals will include guidance for employers in helping staff return to work following bouts of mental illness.   Mrs May is also thought to have ordered new guidance for schools to help them identify vulnerable youngsters affected by problems like cyber-bullying, \u2018sexting\u2019 and the increasing pressure to perform well in exams.   Monday\u2019s speech is designed to reassure voters that Mrs May\u2019s domestic agenda has not been sidelined by the demands of the Brexit issue.   Aides have been exasperated by the level of media coverage of Government splits over the issue. But they accept much of Mrs May\u2019s time in the coming months will inevitably be dominated by Brexit in the run-up to the triggering of formal divorce proceedings in March.        Civil servants should resign if they cannot accept Brexit, a senior MP said yesterday.   Bernard Jenkin, Tory chairman of the Commons public administration committee, which oversees the work of the civil service, said officials had to come to terms with the referendum result quickly or get out.   Eurosceptics and Whitehall mandarins have been locked in a war of words this week following the surprise resignation of Britain\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers.",

The team also looked at how events can affect traffic to Pornhub, including the Olympic Games, Major League Baseball, Snow Storms and the Presidential Election.   For the second year in a row, 'lesbian' was the number one search term in the world.   A new search term that came 11th in popularity was 'Overwatch,' in reference to a first-person shooter video game released this year which is known for its sexualized characters that have inspired fan made videos.   Kim Kardashian is still being searched for more than any other porn star on the site, and her half-sister Kylie Jenner is the second most popular celebrity search.    Angelia Jolie, Donald Trump and Beyonce ranked 3rd, 4th and 5th respectively in terms of celebrity searches.    Four of the Trump's make the top 20 popular celebrity searches: Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump, in that order.    The most searched for terms by women were lesbian, lesbians scissoring and threesome.    For men, the most searched for terms were milf, step mom and step sister.   The top three countries with the highest proportion of female visitors were Jamaica (46 per cent), Micronesia (42 per cent) and the Bahamas (42 per cent).     The top three US states that spent the longest time per visit were Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas.    The states that spent the shortest amount of time per visit were Oregon, Utah and Kansas.   Like last year, the three states with the longest average visits were all southern states.     In June 2014 Google released 'Google Cardboard', an affordable VR headset.   Facebook, Samsung and Sony have released their own version of the headset and Pornhub launched its own VR category - which initially only had 30 videos.    By the end of the year the category had over 1,800 videos, and counting. Some of the most popular VR related search terms on Pornhub include 360 VR, 360 Degree, VR Hentai and shemale VR, to name a few.   Major television events and broadcasts have a huge impact on traffic to Pornhub.    During an awards show Pornhub usually sees a slight drop in traffic, and the Golden Globes is the show that decreases traffic to the site the most.    Award shows typically affect traffic from the US, but other shows affect traffic around the world.",

Scroll down for video    They continued to search into the evening for the plane's fuselage debris despite rough conditions that limited visibility to less than a foot just off shore from downtown Cleveland.   Authorities later said they had concluded their search for the day and would be meeting to determine their next steps.   Transmissions from a locator beacon detector helped narrow the search area, but divers moved slowly as they followed the signals.    Daytime temperatures have been in the teens throughout the search, and Friday's noon reading in Cleveland was 14 degrees with a wind chill of 3.    The search by air and along the shore for debris continued as weather permitted.     Investigators have said the cockpit voice recorder appeared to be intact and would be sent to Washington, D.C., for further examination.    National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim Sorenson said the review is only in the beginning stages.     Searchers said previously they were looking for the cockpit voice recorder in an underwater area about 125 feet by 325 feet.     They have found almost daily debris that is consistent with the Cessna 525 Citation, which vanished shortly after takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport on December 29.    The plane was piloted by John T. Fleming, the president of a Columbus beverage distribution company.    The passengers were his wife, Suzanne Fleming; their teenage sons, Jack and Andrew; and two neighbors, Brian Casey and his 19-year-old daughter, Megan Casey, a freshman nursing student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.   The group was returning to Columbus after attending a Cleveland Cavaliers game in downtown Cleveland.   The Flemings' relatives have scheduled calling hours Sunday afternoon and a memorial service for Monday morning at a church in Canfield, near Youngstown.    A second memorial is planned Tuesday afternoon at a church in Delaware, north of Columbus.   An obituary for the Flemings said: 'John and his wife, Sue, were high school sweethearts, 1989 graduates of Boardman High School, and 17-year residents of Greater Columbus.'   It revealed: 'Jack was an outstanding young man who dedicated his life to helping his brother. He was Andrew's eyes, his constant companion, and best-ever big brother.'   Andrew went to the Ohio State School for the Blind in Columbus, and also competed in the Special Olympics, according to the obituary.    It said: 'Always the jokester, he was known for his wonderful sense of humor. His faithful service dog, Sandy, was always at his side.'    The families of Fleming and his wife issued a statement thanking supporters for their concern and kindness.    It read: 'The families are touched by the tremendous outpouring of support and continue to be grateful to all the agencies and individuals who have aided in the search and recovery efforts, now in the capable hands of the City of Cleveland.'",

   "7. content": "We all know how depressing it is to put on weight. There can be few of us who don\u2019t despair when we see the needle on the scales creep upwards.   Now imagine what it\u2019s like if you\u2019re an identical twin \u2014 and while you get fatter and fatter, your twin remains resolutely svelte.   This was exactly the position I found myself in just a few years ago. I ballooned to 19st while my identical twin, Chris, stayed at my previous weight of 12\u00bd st. It was unbelievably soul-destroying.   But what made my weight gain even more unbearable was that I, more than anyone, should have known better. Because I\u2019m a doctor. And not just any doctor. With my twin brother, who is also a doctor, I have made numerous television programmes on all things to do with health.   And while I was piling on the pounds, I was also studying for a Masters degree in public health at Harvard University in America, where I was a prestigious Fulbright Scholar \u2014 and this after studying for my medical degree at Oxford.   In short, if anyone should have known how important it was to keep a trim waist \u2014 and how to do it \u2014 it was me.   But the fact that even I managed to put on such a dangerous amount \u2014 my feet would ache from all the excess weight I was carrying \u2014 does underline why so many of us find slimming so difficult.   We are bombarded with confusing, contradictory and sometimes dangerous messages from the endless books, websites, DVDs, magazines, corporations, scientists and gurus who make a living out of weight loss.   Most wannabe dieters are plagued by doubts and questions. Is breakfast important? Do calories matter or should I concentrate on cutting carbs? What about gluten? Did I waste my money on this blender?   Despite all my medical training and practical experience of nutrition, I was as much at sea in the world of weight loss as anyone else \u2014 and just as easily seduced by a fad diet.   But it was painfully obvious from my ever-expanding girth and embarrassing man-boobs that I needed to do something \u2014 and fast.   So I decided to use my medical knowledge to research the science behind practically every diet out there \u2014 from the Dukan to the bone broth diet via Weight Watchers and the baby food diet \u2014 and tried a fair few of them myself. Many were impractical, unsustainable and boring. Surely there had to be a better way to lose weight?   That\u2019s when I created my own diet, inspired by the best bits I\u2019d found from all those other diets, but instead made simple, healthy and effective.   How To Lose Weight Well starts in tomorrow\u2019s Mail, with a free 32-page magazine packed with delicious recipes, plus an essential free diet diary to help you stay on track. It continues all next week in a series of special pullouts with lots more easy, mouthwatering meals.   The principles behind my diet are simple. If you want to lose weight fast, eat just one healthy, delicious meal a day (I recommend eating at dinner time) and stick below 800 calories a day.   You could lose up to a stone in two weeks this way, and experience all the health benefits that come with intermittent periods of fasting while you\u2019re at it. This version of my plan is a bit like a more concentrated type of 5:2 diet \u2014 where you eat normally for five days a week and fast for two \u2014 and is a great kick-start for rapid weight loss.   The second version of my diet plan is equally straightforward: to lose weight at a slower but still effective pace, skip either breakfast or lunch and enjoy two healthy meals, totalling around 1,200 calories a day. And the third way? You guessed it: eat three healthy meals a day, totalling around 1,500 calories, that are high in fibre, low in carbs and rich in healthy fats.   That\u2019s it: super-simple, while also being healthy and tasty (of course, if you have any health worries, you should always check with your GP before embarking on any diet).   It is thanks to this plan that I\u2019ve lost that six stone of excess weight and haven\u2019t strayed above 13st for the past four years.   If you had seen me as a teenager, you would find it hard to believe that I managed to get myself into such a gargantuan state.   Both Chris and I were fit, slim, athletic teens. We rowed and swam for Oxford University when we were studying for our medical degrees. And we involuntarily burned more calories than we could consume walking miles and miles along hospital corridors in the years we spent as junior doctors. But in 2009, when we reached 30, our lives went in different directions.   I moved to the U.S. and started a family \u2014 and my weight went through the roof. In the space of 12 months, I put on 6\u00bd st, with my 6ft frame reaching a peak of 19st. Pictures of Chris and me together at the time reveal a pretty shocking contrast, which people couldn\u2019t help but comment on.   When we were both working with genetics expert Professor Tim Spector on a programme investigating the dynamics of twins, he took one look at me, checked my health statistics and declared: \u2018You are a disgrace to your genes.\u2019   He was right. But when I look back at my weight-gain years, it isn\u2019t easy to pinpoint precisely what went wrong. I\u2019m sure many of you will have found this, too.   I suppose I could blame stress. Not only had I moved to a different country to study at one of the world\u2019s most high-pressure universities, but I was also dealing with new fatherhood (my son was born in 2008). No wonder my anxiety levels were creeping up.   I could also blame what you might politely term opportunism \u2014 or, more accurately, greed. For my apartment was directly above a gourmet burger bar and next door to a burrito restaurant. I also became a passionate enthusiast for Chinese takeaways.   As well as all this, though, I was in denial. Yes, all that delicious food was immensely enjoyable \u2014 and I was in a land of large people where being 19st is perfectly acceptable.   This is surely a factor behind many people\u2019s weight gain. As more of us become fatter, it is too easy to look around you and think that is the norm.   But it shouldn\u2019t be. And looking back, there\u2019s no doubt I was eating too much \u2014 but I\u2019d never had to restrain my eating before and I refused to start, instead stubbornly ignoring my expanding figure.   All the while my health was clearly suffering.   When I finished my Masters at Harvard, I remember receiving my graduation photo and being startled to see a fat man with boobs looking back at me.   Not only did my feet ache under this new strain, but eating all that rich food meant I was suffering terrible indigestion and acid reflux, in which stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus, causing a painful burning feeling.   I even had to sleep with my head and shoulders propped up, to make it harder for the acid to travel upwards in this way.   Then, at the end of 2009, I flew back to the UK to start filming the BBC series The Secret Life Of Twins with Chris \u2014 only to find there wasn\u2019t one item of clothing among those I\u2019d left in my wardrobe in the UK at the beginning of the year that still fitted me 12 months on.   Health checks for the TV programme revealed what I had been trying to ignore \u2014 my blood pressure had skyrocketed, and tests showed I was right on the edge of getting type 2 diabetes.   Chris was understandably worried, seeing my explosive weight gain as a sign that I must be unhappy. He begged me to do something about it.   So I tried but it was almost impossible. Even with all my knowledge, it required a superhuman effort to get the numbers on the scales to shift at all.   Because look into dieting in any depth and you will find not just a total lack of consensus about what works and what doesn\u2019t but wild, angry arguments.   This is ridiculous because the issues are not really very complicated. Compared with questions such as \u2018how should I raise my children?\u2019 and \u2018how do you make more money?\u2019, agreeing on what to eat and how to exercise to feel good, look good and live long shouldn\u2019t be hard.   Yet it seemed to be at first. I tried running, but my thighs chafed painfully. So I tried eating a bit less instead, but I was flummoxed without a structure or plan.   I had tried the Paleo diet, where you eat foods that approximate to those of Paleolithic humans \u2014 red meat and vegetables, but no farmed grains or processed foods. Yet I found it just wasn\u2019t a way of eating I could sustain.   I also knew about the low-carb diet, after reading all the medical research and interviewing experts. But when I tried extreme low-carb dieting for myself, I found existing on meat, fish, eggs and cheese extremely boring, constipating and, in the long term, unhealthy. In short, despite all my efforts, nothing seemed to be working.   Even if the numbers on the scales did dip temporarily, they would quickly creep back up.   The turning point came when I moved away from the U.S. and told myself: \u2018Enough \u2014 I\u2019m a doctor, I know how to do this.\u2019   It was this personal journey that led me to make the TV series How To Lose Weight Well (series two is currently on Channel 4 on Tuesdays at 8pm) and ultimately to devise my diet.   While the plan is based on my personal experience of dieting and weight gain, I have also drawn on more than a decade of research, interviews, documentary-making and painstaking examination of the scientific literature.   I promise, you really don\u2019t need to try another diet because I\u2019ve done all the hard graft for you.   I\u2019ve examined just about all the diets out there. And I mean examined. I read almost every diet book, looked into every fad \u2014 and as well as most of the major diet plans, I tried various really weird weight-loss regimens.   I don\u2019t know any other doctors who have done this. Indeed, the world of fad dieting receives little serious medical scrutiny.   Today, I live between London and America. I\u2019m a lecturer at Fordham University in New York and still make TV programmes with my twin Chris. And I\u2019ve stayed slim for the past four years, which I\u2019m very proud of.   It\u2019s now not hard for me to keep the weight off. Yes, I have to devote a little concentration each day to stop myself eating exactly what I please. But that\u2019s all.   Having been there, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s your fault you\u2019re overweight. But I do believe anyone can get to the weight they want without endangering their health or suffering too much \u2014 and I hope How To Lose Weight Well will help you do that. After all, it\u2019s the best of everything I know about weight loss: ideas begged, borrowed, adapted... or learned the hard way.

Hackston and his team conducted an online survey with 368 people following a personality questionnaire.   Explorer   - Remember that not everyone wants to meet face-to-face all of the time.   - Don\u2019t feel you have to set up subfolders if you\u2019ll never actually use them.   - Remember that people are often waiting for a quick response.   Visionary   -You like to compose your thoughts, but remember some people expect a quick response \u2013 if you can\u2019t respond quickly then consider sending a holding email to manage expectations.   - Remember that sometimes calling someone or having face-to-face meeting may be preferred by others.   Director   - If someone takes time responding, they may be thinking through their answer, not procrastinating.   - Be tactful if you receive emails that contain mistakes, or if emails don\u2019t get to the point,   - Avoid being too direct if stressed,   Analyst   - If a quick response is necessary, consider a holding email,   - Email may not be the best platform for a debate,   Nurturer   - Don\u2019t be offended when people omit pleasantries \u2013 it might mean others are under stress or overwhelmed by emails,   - If responding quickly, take time to double check the content and who you are sending the email to,   - Remember that not everyone wants to meet face-to-face all of the time.   Conscience   - Remember that some people need a quick response \u2013 if you can\u2019t respond quickly then consider sending a holding email to manage expectations.   - Be clear and concise, so that others will actually read your message properly   - Don\u2019t forget to include a subject line.   Activist   - Check if you\u2019ve sent all the emails you started today   - Don\u2019t skim read, as you put yourself at risk of missing valuable information or actions.   - Give people time to reflect and remember not everyone wants to talk face-to-face or provide an immediate response.   Conserver   - When you have to concentrate, turn off email notifications so you aren\u2019t distracted   - Don\u2019t always use email, you may want to consider meeting face-to-face or speaking over the phone.   - If you do not get a response, don\u2019t be afraid to follow-up, because not everyone checks their emails as vigilantly as you do.    Source:  OPP    And it was those with a big picture focus that may feel more pressure than others.   This group was found to check emails on holidays, over the weekend and before heading into work and also after leaving.   Researchers noted that sending emails outside of work hours also leads to stress, as does the amount of emails you send and receive.   It was also found that managers, regardless of their personality type, are more likely to feel that they waste time on emails and find it overwhelming and stressful.   However, people with different personality preferences found different aspects of using email stressful.   These findings could be useful in creating guidance to help individuals cope with emails.   Another study focusing on emails reveals the worst day to send these digital messages.   A new study reveals that Monday is the worst day to send emails.    Boomerang, a firm designs software to help people be more email productive, discovered that we are prone to make more mistakes on this day- specifically in the email subject line.   The company also found this type of mistake decreases the chances of receiving a response from 34% to 29%.    Subject sentences starting with a lowercase letter also reduce the response rate.   And so will extremely short or long subjects.    Boomerang , a firm designs software to help people be more email productive, found that we tend to make more errors on the first day of the week - specifically typos in the subject line.   The research also found that the chances of getting a response to an email with mistakes in the subject line drops by 14 percent.    To reach these results, the California based company fed 250,000 emails through an automated grammar-checking library to analyze error rates and sentiment over a weeks time.   'We first looked at the number of subject line errors flagged over the course of a week, and sure enough, Monday was when subject lines were most error-prone, Boomerang writes in the blog post.   Not only will you feel anxious once you realize the email was sent with mistakes, but Boomerang also found that it is less likely to get a response.   The team found that error free subject  have a 34 percent chance of receiving a reply, but make a few mistakes and that number drops down to 29 percent \u2013 a 14 percent decrease.   This isn't the first time the subject line meant life or death for your email, as has also been known that extremely short or long subjects can also lower response rates.   'But subject errors also correlated with lower response rates when we looked only at emails with four-word subjects,' Boomerang explains.   'So while subject length and subject errors can both affect response rates negatively, it appears they act independently of each other.'   Frequency  - Those with something to hide sent 1.14 emails per month to people they were trying to hide it from compared to 0.67 emails per month before they held the secret.    Response time  - Secret keepers responded more quickly to those they were trying to keep in the dark, picking up the time from 13.1 hours before they had a secret, to 4.96 hours, after a secret.    Language  - They also used more second person pronouns and more present tense verbs in emails to their friends.    Emails to a confidant included a greater frequency of negative emotional words such as 'hurt' and 'tired' along with words related to a sense of caution such as 'realize' and 'if'.   And the firm found that not all errors in the subject line are considered equal.   Subject sentences starting with a lowercase letter are considered a 'significant error'.   These emails only have a 28.4 percent chance of getting a response, compared to a 32.6 percent reply rate for those with proper capitalization.   Boomerang also found data that supports something many already suspected \u2013 Mondays can also put us in a bad mood.   While looking at numerous email subject lines, the firm discovered that emails sent on the first day of the week are the least positive.   'Not only do emails sent on Mondays have the lowest subject sentiment on average, it's a steep drop off from Sunday, which has the most positive email subjects,' explains Boomerang.   Unfortunate Mondays will most likely continue to give us the blues, but Boomerang suggests writing Mondays emails ahead of time and schedule them to send later so you have time to review them before they go out.",

Noel Conway, 67, who has motor neurone disease is planning a judicial review against the Government.   The retired social sciences lecturer was diagnosed with the disease in November 2014 and does not expect to live more than another 12 months. Mr Conway, who is supported in his legal challenge by his wife Carol, 57, enjoyed hiking, cycling and travelling before becoming ill.   He is now dependent on a ventilator to breathe overnight, and is losing his ability to move, dress, eat and deal with his personal care independently.   He said yesterday: \u2018If I let nature take its course, I could effectively become entombed in my own body... or I may die by suffocation or choking.\u2019   The 1961 Suicide Act makes it a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison for anyone to assist in a suicide.   Mr Conway\u2019s case is the first brought since that of Tony Nicklinson, which occurred in 2014 \u2013 two years after he had died.   That case was dismissed by the Supreme Court, with judges stating Parliament needed to debate the matter. Subsequently, in a free vote in the Commons in 2015, 118 MPs were in favour and 330 against plans to allow terminally ill adults to end their lives with medical supervision.   Mr Conway\u2019s legal team say his case is different from Mr Nicklinson\u2019s because it will include safeguards to protect vulnerable people.   Mr Conway, from Shrewsbury, has two adult children and one grandchild. He is bringing this case over his right to have the option of an assisted death in his final six months of life.   Speaking of his decision, Mr Conway said: \u2018I have motor neurone disease. It is incurable and terminal. It is a muscle wasting disease and I am now heading for its final stages when I face not being able to move at all.   \u2018This prospect is terrifying and the amount of suffering unimaginable.   \u2018Current law means that I will have no control of how my life ends and I will have to endure this nightmare for as long as it takes.   \u2018As someone who has always been in control of his life and taking responsibility for himself, I find this quite unacceptable.   \u2018I want to change the law to allow assisted dying so that I can be in control of my own death.\u2019   However, Baroness Campbell, who has spinal muscular atrophy and founded the organisation Not Dead Yet disagrees with his view. She uses a powered wheelchair, is fed through a tube and can now move only two of her fingers.   She told the BBC: \u2018If the law was changed it would feed into society\u2019s fear that being very disabled like me is a state worse than death. We already have to fight to live, a right to die would be a huge and frightening burden.\u2019",

Scroll down for video    The reddish feature in the middle of the Earth image is Australia.    Southeast Asia appears as the reddish area (due to vegetation) near the top.   Antarctica is the bright blob at bottom-left.    Other bright areas are clouds.       When the component images were taken on Nov. 20, 2016 by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars was about 127 million miles (205 million kilometers) from Earth.   Each was separately processed prior to combining them so that the moon is bright enough to see.    The moon is much darker than Earth and would barely be visible at the same brightness scale as Earth.    The combined view retains the correct sizes and positions of the two bodies relative to each other.   HiRISE takes images in three wavelength bands: infrared, red, and blue-green.   These are displayed here as red, green, and blue, respectively.    This is similar to Landsat images in which vegetation appears red.    The reddish feature in the middle of the Earth image is Australia.    Researchers have thought that during the spring, sunshine penetrates the ice and warms the ground underneath.   This causes some carbon dioxide on the bottom of the sheet to that, turning into gas.   The gas, in turn, becomes trapped and pressure increases until a crack forms in the ice sheet.   Then, the gas erupts out, and that beneath the ice rushes toward the vent, gathering particles of sand and dust, eroding the ground.   The process also supplies the geyser with particles, which fall back to the surface, downwind, and create dark spring fans.   The sites spotted near the south pole are at spring-fan sites, and have persisted and grown through three Mars years, and formed branches resembling the spidery terrain.   The researchers say sand may \u2018jump start\u2019 the process of carving a channel in the ground.     Southeast Asia appears as the reddish area (due to vegetation) near the top; Antarctica is the bright blob at bottom-left. Other bright areas are clouds.   These images were acquired for calibration of HiRISE data, since the spectral reflectance of the Moon's near side is very well known.",

Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year \u2013 his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million.    However, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year.    The filing, first reported by  The Wall Street Journal , also lists how badly of a year the Cupertino company had altogether.   Apple\u2019s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target.   And as a result, the executives were only given 89.5 percent of their targeted annual cash incentive.   While Cook\u2019s base salary did increase from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year, his \u2018incentive plan compensation\u2019 dropped from $8 million to $5.37 million.   His incentive pay may have taken a hit, but the CEO still took home a total of 11.74 million for 2016.    On the other hand, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year - but each took home more than 23 million in total.    A filing from August highlighted that Cook received 1.26 million Apple shares, valued at around $135 million at the time, that were previously restricted.   He earned a majority of these shares by sitting as CEO for Apple for five years.   And the reset were given to Cook because of Apple\u2019s stock performance.      The drop in sales for 2016 may have been a result users being disappointed with the new iPhone 7 line - as it seems to be just a refreshed iPhone 6.    It was also found in a survey that Apple products only accounted for 44 percent of new smartphone and tablet activations in the week leading up to Christmas.   And although that was more than double what Samsung had \u2013 Apple was still down by 5 percent from 2015.   The iPhone 7 may have been a flop among the crowd, but the firm says the next smartphone will be 'the most radical design ever'.   The iPhone 8 is set to be unveiled this year for the firm\u2019s 10 year anniversary \u2013 so many iOS users are sure Apple will impress them with new cutting edge technology.    Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:    - Dual-lens 3D camera    - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings    - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen    - Wireless charging    - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models    - A new 'pure white' model.   An unnamed employee at an Apple site in Herzliya, Israel, where hardware is being developed for the iPhone 8, has leaked some details about the new handset in September 2016.   The unnamed employee told  Business Insider  that the iPhone 8 would be 'different' from previous handsets, which have been critiqued as being too similar.    Until now, little has been known about Apple's next iPhone, although reports by a source speaking to  Nikkei Asian Review  have said that it will have a curved screen.   If those rumors are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year.   The employee also mentioned that the iPhone 8 would have a better camera \u2013 although this usually happens with every update.",

NASA said it could have as much effect on the surface as a meteoroid impact.   Scroll down for video   The moon has almost no atmosphere, so its surface is exposed to the harsh space environment.    Impacts from small meteoroids constantly churn or 'garden' the top layer of the dust and rock, called regolith, on the moon.          'About 10 percent of this gardened layer has been melted or vaporized by meteoroid impacts,' said Andrew Jordan of the University of New Hampshire, Durham.    'We found that in the moon's permanently shadowed regions, sparks from solar storms could melt or vaporize a similar percentage.'    Jordan is lead author of a paper on this research published online in Icarus August 31, 2016.   Explosive solar activity, like flares and coronal mass ejections, blasts highly energetic, electrically charged particles into space.    Earth's atmosphere shields us from most of this radiation, but on the moon, these particles - ions and electrons - slam directly into the surface.    They accumulate in two layers beneath the surface; the bulky ions can't penetrate deeply because they are more likely to hit atoms in the regolith, so they form a layer closer to the surface while the tiny electrons slip through and form a deeper layer.   The ions have positive charge while the electrons carry negative charge. Since opposite charges attract, normally these charges flow towards each other and balance out.   In August 2014, however, Jordan's team published simulation results predicting that strong solar storms would cause the regolith in the moon's permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) to accumulate charge in these two layers until explosively released, like a miniature lightning strike.    The PSRs are so frigid that regolith becomes an extremely poor conductor of electricity.    Therefore, during intense solar storms, the regolith is expected to dissipate the build-up of charge too slowly to avoid the destructive effects of a sudden electric discharge, called dielectric breakdown.    The research estimates the extent that this process can alter the regolith.   'This process isn't completely new to space science -- electrostatic discharges can occur in any poorly conducting (dielectric) material exposed to intense space radiation, and is actually the leading cause of spacecraft anomalies,' said Timothy Stubbs of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, a co-author of the paper.    The team estimated the energy that would be deposited over a million years by both meteoroid impacts and dielectric breakdown driven by solar storms, and found that each process releases enough energy to alter the regolith by a similar amount.   'Lab experiments show that dielectric breakdown is an explosive process on a tiny scale,' said Jordan.    'During breakdown, channels could be melted and vaporized through the grains of soil.    'Some of the grains may even be blown apart by the tiny explosion.'    The next step is to search for evidence of dielectric breakdown in PSRs and determine if it could happen in other areas on the moon.    There may even be 'sparked' material in the Apollo samples, but the difficulty would be determining if this material was altered by breakdown or a meteoroid impact.",

Although a fraction of those who were ravaged during celebrations in Cologne the previous year, the incidents have shocked Austria which has taken in over 80,000 migrants.   In Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel remains under constant pressure from her party allies in Bavaria to place a cap on refugee numbers - something she refuses to do despite rising anxiety and the bloody terror attack in Berlin.   Now her tiny neighbour is going it alone with a proposal to be presented to Brussels next week. They say the plan will radically change the game in Europe and banish a hitherto 'failed' system.   'We need to end the failed European asylum policy', sard Doskozil. 'We must all of us admit, and honestly say, that the absorption capacity in the EU for refugess is limited.'   He backed a call for detention centres outside the EU where applications for asylum could be made before migrants set foot in the bloc.   In Germany, CSU Chief Horst Seehofer - head of the conservative party in Bavaria upon which Chancellor Merkel relies on - wants a cap on no more than 200,000 refugees a year.   He has made this a condition of supporting the chancellor in her bid for a fourth term in office in the general election to be held in the autumn of this year. But she once again categorically rejects an upper limit.   Austria is also signalling to the EU that it will look after its frontiers if bureaucrats hundreds of miles away will not. It says border controls will be extended indefinitely. 'As long as is the European Union not to be able to protect its external borders, we will use national measures in Austria,' said Sobotka.   Germany is also defying Brussels on this issue. Interior minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re announced at the end of the year he intended to continue border controls beyond the February 2017 limit set by the EU.",

It was announced on the same day a declassified U.S. intelligence report said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"ordered\" an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. \n The declassified report said that Russian intelligence services had \"obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.\" None of the systems targeted or compromised was involved in vote tallying, the report said. \n A 2013 presidential directive identified 16 sectors as critical infrastructures, including energy, financial services, health care, transportation, food and agriculture and communications. \n The designation announced Friday places responsibilities on the Homeland Security secretary to identify and prioritize those sectors, considering physical and cyber threats against them. The secretary is also required to conduct security checks and provide information about emerging and imminent threats. \n Such a change does not require presidential action, and only requires the secretary to first consult with the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. \n Discussions about whether to designate elections systems as critical infrastructure surfaced after hackers targeted the voter registration systems of more than 20 states in the months prior to the November election. \n While the designation puts responsibilities on the Department of Homeland Security, it does not require entities that are determined \"critical infrastructure\" to participate. Much of the nation's critical infrastructure is in the private sector. \n Johnson said election infrastructure included storage facilities, polling places and vote tabulation locations, plus technology involved in the process, including voter registration databases, voting machines and other systems used to manage the election process and report and display results. \n The designation allows for information to be withheld from the public when state, local and private partners meet to discuss election infrastructure security \u2014 potentially injecting secrecy into an election process that's traditionally and expressly a transparent process. U.S. officials say such closed door conversations allow for frank discussion that would prevent bad actors from learning about vulnerabilities. DHS would also be able to grant security clearances when appropriate and provide more detailed threat information to states. \n The Obama administration has proposed international cyber rules for peacetime that would expressly note that countries shouldn't conduct online activity targeting critical infrastructure, which will now also include election systems. \n President Barack Obama used sanctions last week to retaliate against Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election process by expanding a prior executive order that allows for their use in the case of cyberattack on critical infrastructure to entities \"interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\" With election infrastructure designated as critical, an attack that takes the system down would also qualify for a response of sanctions. \n Georgia Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp, who is a member of the U.S. Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group run by DHS, is among those who have opposed the designation. Testifying in September to a House Oversight subcommittee, Kemp said more federal oversight could make systems more vulnerable and could make protected records more accessible. \n When Johnson discussed the likelihood of the designation in a conference call with state officials on Thursday, Kemp called the action \"a federal overreach into a sphere constitutionally reserved for the states.\" According to a copy of his comments released by his office, Kemp told Johnson on the phone that \"this smacks of partisan politics\" given the dwindling days left in the Obama administration. \n Kemp has appealed to President-elect Donald Trump to investigate \"failed cyberattacks\" on the Georgia secretary of state's network that traced to the Department of Homeland Security, calling the department's technical explanations insufficient.",

'You don't want people to know you are struggling, you feel like a failure, you think people will judge you and many women are afraid their children will be taken off them.'   In a frank blog post she said every comment she heard about herself or her children affected her profoundly.     'I say suffered and I mean it. I\u2019ll keep this simple. There\u2019s no need for a Gandhi like analysis of wisdom here. It's as simple as this. I was suicidal.    'I'm not going to say I wanted to die. Nobody wants to die, but I thought I had to. I simply didn\u2019t know how to live anymore and I didn\u2019t want to.    'Not because I didn\u2019t love my children, but because I loved them too much, if that\u2019s even possible,' she wrote.   Her depression worsened until she felt like she was 'at rock bottom's basement, trapped and alone.'     But one night she was lying with her daughter Frankie who told her she was 'the best mommy in the world and I don't want anyone else to be my mommy.'   Afterwards Emma stopped feeling depressed. 'Just like that, this tiny person saved me,' she said.    'I realized that very second that it doesn't matter what anyone thinks of you as a mother except the little humans who call you \"mom\",' she added.",

Almost half of couples labelled infertile after trying unsuccessfully for a baby for a year will, studies show, fall pregnant in the next two years if they just keep trying.   But many panic and pay thousands of pounds for IVF, a British Fertility Society conference heard, because they believe they have a medical problem and need treatment.   Professor Siladitya Bhattacharya, from the University of Aberdeen, has said the problem is couples expecting to start their family 'on demand'.   While IVF can help some couples with unexplained infertility, and works particularly for women over the age of 40, many more will waste their money and time, taking large amounts of drugs to stimulate their ovaries and having invasive treatment when they could have got pregnant without ever seeing a doctor.   Addressing the conference in Edinburgh this week, Professor Bhattacharya said: 'The evidence in support of the effectiveness of IVF on its own in couples with infertility can be challenged, because if you looked at a new treatment which was just becoming available with this data in front of you, we would hesitate to say this is a treatment you need to spend time and money on.'   Despite the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, having been born almost 40 years ago, the evidence to show how well IVF works is still very limited.    One study of infertile couples, from the journal Human Reproduction in 2010, found as few as 13 per cent had a baby as a direct result of IVF, with many falling pregnant naturally or with other treatments.   Another Dutch study suggests as many as a third of couples with a good chance of becoming pregnant chose to have IVF unnecessarily, opting for 'overtreatment'.   Professor Bhattacharya told the conference: 'There is a great belief in a reproductive \"switch\", turned off with contraception and then on at will.   'Because pregnancy prevention can happen on demand, the corollary of that is there is an expectation conception can happen on demand.'   He said people want a child within 'record time', in a society where instant gratification is the norm, adding: 'When you have a talking fridge in your kitchen now, the expectation is you will be able to conceive when you want to.'   Couples who are unable to get pregnant after trying for 12 months are classed as having unexplained infertility, which experts say many think means they cannot have children.   Many are rushed into having children, even though the guidance from NICE is to wait for two years before seeking treatment.   The Aberdeen fertility expert added: 'The expectation, as in any branch of medicine, is that if you are sick, you need treatment, and so it can be very, very counter-intuitive to argue against this.'   He is calling for more evidence that IVF is better than doing nothing.   However IVF is more effective in couples who have been unsuccessful using clomifene, a drug used to stimulate ovulation, or intra-uterine insemination which separates fast-moving sperm.   Responding to the call for IVF to be looked at again, Professor Geeta Nargund, medical director of Create Fertility, said: 'It is important not to use unnecessary IVF treatments, drugs and interventions.   'The first option must be to help couples achieve a natural conception unless there is clear evidence for intervention.'",

Quine was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery for ransom and sentenced to life without parole after Shahid Ali Baig was shot dead in Los Angeles, California in 1980. Quine was held in Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California, according to court documents filed in 2014.",
   "7. content": "A 57-year-old convicted killer serving a life sentence in California became the first US inmate to receive sexual reassignment surgery funded by the state.   California prison officials agreed  to pay for Shiloh Heavenly Quine's operation in 2015 under the Eighth Amendment, which requires prisons to treatment for medical and mental health conditions, including gender dysphoria.   Her case has blazed the trail for other transgender inmates to apply for state-funded sex-reassignment surgery.   Quine was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery for ransom and sentenced to life without parole after Shahid Ali Baig was shot dead in Los Angeles, California in 1980.      Quine was held in Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California, according to court documents filed in 2014.    She will be moved to a women's prison after the operation, which was performed at a hospital in San Francisco, her attorneys said.   Quine's case has also prompted a federal magistrate to require California to provide transgender female inmates housed in men's facilities with clothing and commissary items ranging from nightgowns to necklaces.   Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center, which represents Quine and other transgender inmates, heralded the settlement as a victory.   'For too long, institutions have ignored doctors and casually dismissed medically necessary and life-saving care for transgender people just because of who we are,' he said     Completion of the surgery not only fulfills a landmark legal settlement but marks a victory 'for all transgender people who have ever been denied the medical care we need,' Hayashi said.    But the daughter of Quine's victim said she objects to inmates getting taxpayer-funded surgery that is not readily available to non-criminals, regardless of the cost.   Quine and an accomplice kidnapped and fatally shot Baig, a 33-year-old father of three, in downtown Los Angeles in February 1980, stealing $80 and his car during a drug- and alcohol-fueled rampage.    'My dad begged for his life,' said Farida Baig, who tried unsuccessfully to block Quine's surgery through the courts.   'It just made me dizzy and sick. I'm helping pay for his surgery. I live in California. It's kind of like a slap in the face, she added.    California was legally required to pay for the operation, corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton said.   'The Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution requires that prisons provide inmates with medically necessary treatment for medical and mental health conditions including inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria,' Thornton said in a written statement.   California corrections officials had fought in court for years to avoid paying for sex-reassignment surgeries.    In one high-profile case, the state paroled Michelle-Lael Norsworthy in 2015, just one day before a federal appeals court was to hear her request for state-funded surgery.   Quine told a prison psychologist who recommended her for the operation that it would bring a 'drastic, internal completeness.'   She expects it will end a dysfunction and depression so deep that she tried to cut and hang herself in prison five times - most recently in 2014 when she was initially told she could not have the operation.   Quine 'felt herself to be a female as early as nine years old', and expressed her gender by dressing in female clothes during a school event at the age of 12, according to court documents filed 2014.        Quine said she tried unsuccessfully to amputate her genitalia when she was about 19, three years before she went to prison.    It was roughly around the same time she tried self-medicating with illegally purchased female hormones.   'She experiences severe [gender] dysphoria and distress resulting from the incongruence between her male physical features and her female gender identity,' according to court documents.   Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal court-appointed official who controls California's prison medical care, said the cost of sex-reassignment surgeries could approach $100,000, including procedures and medications before and after the operation.   Attorneys at the Oakland-based Transgender Law Center said that figure is exaggerated.   A portion of the state's expense will generally be reimbursed by the federal government, Hayhoe said. The percentage varies depending on individual circumstances, but it can cover up to 95 percent of allowable charges.",

Prosecutors would later call the enclosure a 'holding pen' and describe the conditions inside the child\u2019s living space as deplorable.   When Giddings and Bushey discovered Ellyah lying unconscious in the room, they took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead from asphyxiation, meaning that he could not breathe.   During a court hearing last month, investigators testified that Ms Giddings admitted to them that she would keep her toddler son without supervision inside the filthy room for up to five hours at a time.   Ellyah's biological father, Joshua Elvidge, expressed dismay upon learning of his late son's unsafe living conditions.    \u2018It's very sickening, and I just wish she could look me in the eyes because what they described, in my eyes, is that he was living like a pig. Like an animal,\u2019 he told the station after the hearing.   Giddings and Bushey broke up shortly after Ellyah's death and the man moved to New Jersey, where he was arrested on December 16 and later extradited back to New York, reported the  Press Republican.    Giddings, who is believed to have a younger child, was taken into custody three days before her ex-boyfriend. Both are being held at Clinton County Jail on $100,000 bond.   Bushey is due back in court on January 21, while Giddings is set to appear before a judge on February 8. If convicted, the pair could face up to four years in prison.",

Deianeira Ford, who is biracial, was at the drive-through with her two children when she did not receive her full order and was told she could not get the rest of it.   Ford, 21, asked for a $5 refund from Jim Crichton, the Zion store's owner.    That's when he called the mother and her children n*****s, she said. Her three-year-old daughter asked her what the word meant.    Ford then tried to find out Crichton's name. He first told her it was 'Bill Clinton' then said 'better yet, I'm Donald Trump'.    Crichton then told Ford to  go 'back where I came from', she claims.   An officer arrived at the restaurant around 11.30am on Wednesday and found Ford 'visibly upset and crying', according to the police report.    After Ford explained what happened, the officer informed Crichton that she was 'so disturbed' by the owner's behavior that she was willing to sign a complaint against him.    '(Crichton) boastfully told me he would be happy to go to jail over the issue and proudly admitted to calling Ford a slur,' the officer wrote in his report.    'He added that he was \"fed up with black people\"'.    The officer wrote that Crichton also used racial slurs 'freely to describe black people'.   But when the same officer was called to the store later that day, after a Black Lives Matter organizer arrived to talk to Crichton, the owner had changed his tune.    Crichton had called police to complain he was getting harassing telephone calls about the incident and that he wanted the organizer to leave the store.    The organizer left when the officer asked him to, but Crichton did not recognize the cop and told him an earlier incident had taken place with a woman that same day.    Critchton claimed that 'nothing racial took place' with Ford, despite boasting about using the slur to the same officer just hours before.    'He did not recognize me as the officer who spoke to him this morning and I reminded him that he already admitted to me what he did,' the officer wrote.    'He continued to contradict his story about this morning to me several more times and was becoming angered that I did not believe him.'   Crichton continued to deny the story was true to the  Lake County News-Sun , telling a reporter it was '99 percent lies'.    'This is blown so far out of proportion it's stupid,' he said.    'Her order was confusing, and I told her, \"Here's your money back\". This is blown so far out of proportion.'    But then, on Friday, Crichton apologized for his 'recent words and actions'.    'As the owner of this restaurant, I should be a model for others,' he told the  New York Daily News .    'My actions were inexcusable and unacceptable.'    Ford said she found the incident to 'embarrassing', especially because it was in front of her children.    'That was the hardest thing,' she told the Lake County News-Sun. 'He did it with my children in the back.'    But the Zion community has rallied around Ford, with both the police chief and mayor reaching out and the local Black Lives Matter organization planning a protest in front of the store on Saturday.    Police Chief Stephen Dumyahn said he was 'disgusted and discouraged' by Crichton's comments.    'I reached out to Miss Ford to tell her that this does not represent the diverse community of Zion,' he said.    'Although we recognize the rights of business owners and managers to operate their business as they choose, under the law, we do not condone the inflammatory language that was used or the way this customer was treated,' he added.   Ford said the Dairy Queen CEO also personally called her and sincerely apologized about the incident.    She said the company had someone visit Crichton to express their concerns about it as well.    Dairy Queen also released a statement in support of Ford, writing that they expect all their franchisees and employees to 'treat every single person who walks through their doors with the utmost dignity and respect'.    'Nothing less is acceptable,' it read. 'Nearly all DQ restaurants are run by individual owners. Nevertheless, it is vital that they understand the importance of treating all of our fans with great respect.'    'The actions of this franchisee are inexcusable, reprehensible and unacceptable.'    'We do not in any way condone his behavior or language. It is not what our brand stands for and is not representative of a DQ or its franchisee community.'    Crichton is not facing any charges in relation to the incident, with Zion police noting that although it was 'deplorable' it is 'not criminal'.     'One of the foundational rights we have under the U.S. Constitution is the freedom of speech,' the department's statement read.    'The Zion Police Department is committed to upholding the rights of all citizens, even when we find it morally reprehensible.'",

Her mother, Amy Howell, told her class at Gallatin High School that her daughter, who has a rare brain disease, loved school buses so much she asked for one for Christmas.   In less than a month, her 11th and 12th grade students raised enough money to transform an old school bus into a giant playhouse for Gabby.   Scroll down for video     'For me personally, it was just so sweet,' Amy Howell told  ABC News .    'You put so much of your life into your students. To see it happen, that they want to give back like that, they don't want to do it for the glory, they want to do it because they love you. It was a really sweet thing.'    Jessi Smith, a 12th grader, said the group collected donations from the community and received help from a local middle school which provided art supplies and bean bag chairs to make the school bus a fun place for Gabby.   'Gabby, she ran up to me, she gave me a hug,' Jessi said.    'She ran to Santa and said, 'I love you Santa, thank you so much.' She was screaming and she almost started crying and it was so sweet.'   Mrs Howell shared the story with her students and thought nothing of it.    'I told the story because I thought it was a funny thing for a kid to ask for,' she said.    Gabby was diagnosed with periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) when she was just eight years old.    PVNH is a disorder that causes neurons in the brain to get 'stuck', preventing proper brain activity.   For Gabby, it means that although she grows physically, her brain is incapable of doing the same.   'Today, she can tell you the ABCs and tomorrow she can't. So she'll be like a little three-year-old for the rest of her life,' her mother said.   Despite her disability, Gabby is popular among the Gallatin High School students and enjoys time spent playing with them when she stops by after school.    As well as a gift for Gabby, the group hoped the bus would serve as a token of gratitude to their teacher, Mrs Howell.     'She such a sweet person and she goes above and beyond every single day for all her students,' Jessi continued.    'I wanted to do something to make her happy. Gabby is so sweet too, so I wanted to do this mainly for Mrs. Howell, but also for Gabby.'",

The tax took effect on Jan. 1, with a per-ounce rate 24 times more expensive than the state\u2019s tax on beer. \n The 1.5 cent-per-ounce rate sounds small. But it can add up on purchases of packs and large bottles. \n In one photo that went viral after being posted to Facebook, a receipt shows more than $3 in tax added to the cost of a $5.99 12-pack of Propel, an energy drink. Because of the broad language, the tax captures not only sodas but energy drinks, zero-calorie diet beverages, juice and even milk substitutes for lactose-intolerant people.   \n From a Facebook post, the Philadelphia sugary drink tax implemented today damn, between that & Pennsylvania gas tax no wonder folk revolted  pic.twitter.com/ZUtmufCyQn \u2014 SalenaZito (@SalenaZito)  January 2, 2017 \n \n Other shoppers also sounded off. \n Congrats,  @PhiladelphiaGov .

The revenue will be used to fund initiatives for areas in need of improvement like community schools, parks, rec centers, and libraries \u2013 and for expanding the city\u2019s pre-K programs. \n But the city has been in a legal battle with the American Beverage Association, which opposes the measure. And the Kenney administration has gone to the state Supreme Court seeking a final legal decision. A spokesperson for Kenney told FoxNews.com that without the tax, the city cannot fund additional pre-K seats come September \u2013 and stressed it\u2019s not technically a sales tax. \n \u201cThe Philadelphia Beverage Tax is a tax on the  distribution  of sweetened beverages intended for retail; it is not a sales tax to be paid by the consumer and collected by the retailer,\u201d spokesman Mike Dunn said. \u201cThere are thousands of Philadelphians who are thrilled with the infrastructure this tax will pay for, so it depends on who you\u2019re speaking to.\u201d \n The mayor\u2019s office said there was no \u201cmandate\u201d on consumers, but rather on dealers and distributors who could choose whether to increase prices.   \n \u201cSince it is not a sales tax, distributors \u2026 do not have to pass it down to their customers, the dealers,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThey could choose to slightly lessen their seven-figure bonuses, for example.\u201d \n But McCorkle, a plaintiff in the case against the tax, said despite what the mayor\u2019s office says, the tax will be passed onto consumers. \n \u201cI would ask anyone in the mayor\u2019s office to walk through a supermarket or convenience store\u2014the consumers are seeing a dramatic increase in the price of products in these Philadelphia stores and Philadelphians will vote with their feet by finding a neighboring community where they can buy the products they want at prices they did prior to January 1 st ,\u201d McCorkle said. \u201cIf Philadelphians shop outside the city, sales decline, not only in the beverage category, but in all categories.\u201d \n McCorkle said the Philadelphia economy in general could be affected. \n \u201cI think the city needs to take a hard look at the potential impact, and we suspect that if store revenue declines, cuts have to be made somewhere,\u201d McCorkle said. \n According to the mayor\u2019s office, Philadelphia has established a Healthy Beverages Tax Credit to help those small stores and bodegas McCorkle is concerned about. The credit is offered to \u201cqualifying merchants who increase their inventory of healthy beverages.\u201d \n Philadelphia\u2019s experience could shape how the soda tax debate plays out across the country. Illinois is considering a statewide soda tax, and cities including Santa Fe, N.M., are considering new local levies.",

And he announced his decision publicly and said we\u2019re going to act, we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to respond to this blatant violation of international law and of warnings and of the red line he had chosen,\" he said.  \n \"Now, we were marching towards that time when, lo and behold ... before the Friday decision, Prime Minister David Cameron went to Parliament ... and he sought a vote of approval for him to join in the action that we were going to engage in. And guess what? The Parliament voted no. They shot him down.\"  \n Kerry went on to say that Cameron\u2019s decision to consult Parliament pushed Obama to consult Congress before engaging in airstrikes: \"The president decided that he needed to go to Congress because of what had happened in Great Britain and because he needed the approval.\" \n In the interim, Kerry said, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov reached out to him, and they cooperated on a deal to get rid of Assad\u2019s chemical weapons.  \n \u201cThe president never said, \u2018I won\u2019t drop a bomb.\u2019 What happened was people interpreted it,\u201d Kerry said, acknowledging that \"perception\" hurt.  \n Obama had previously called the U.K. vote \u201ca major factor\u201d in why there was no attack against Assad\u2019s regime, but Kerry's remarks went into more detail. \n When asked for comment on Kerry\u2019s remarks, a spokesman for the U.K. Foreign Office did not address the remarks directly, but defended Britain\u2019s record in Syria and said it will \u201ccontinue to use all of the diplomatic levers at our command to reduce the suffering of the Syrian people by using our voice in the UN Security Council and support efforts to secure a political settlement based on transition away from the Assad regime.\u201d \n \u201cMinisters have repeatedly expressed their disappointment that Parliament did not vote in [favor] of using force against Assad in 2013,\u201d the spokesman added.  \n But critics said the remarks were an attempt by Kerry to gloss over one of the weakest points of Obama\u2019s foreign policy record. \n \u201cKerry is clearly trying to deflect away from the fact that the Obama administration\u2019s Syria policy has been a complete and utter disaster, and this is a rather pathetic attempt to try to blame the British for President Obama\u2019s own failure and lack of judgment,\u201d Nile Gardiner, director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told FoxNews.com.  \n British media including  The Guardian  also picked up on Kerry's comments.  \n Kerry\u2019s remarks come less than a week after the secretary of state upset both the British and Israeli governments by lambasting what he called Israel\u2019s \u201csettler agenda.\u201d \n Defending the decision of the U.S. not to veto a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli settlements, Kerry called the current government the \"most right-wing\" in Israel's history and claimed its agenda is \"driven by the most extreme elements.\" \n The speech sparked fury from the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling the speech \u201cskewed\u201d and warning: \u201cIsraelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders.\u201d \n A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May also said: \u201cWe do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally.\u201d \n Kerry\u2019s claims about Syria aren\u2019t the first time the administration has needled its British allies. In an interview with  The Atlantic  in April, Obama blamed Cameron for what he called \u201ca sh-t show\u201d in Libya, saying Cameron had become \u201cdistracted by a range of other things.\u201d  \n Obama also ruffled feathers last year when he said if the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, it would be at the \"back of the queue\" for trade talks with America. Brits voted to leave anyway.  \n \u201c[Kerry\u2019s remarks are] a reflection of a broader disdain for Britain that runs through the Obama presidency,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cWithout a doubt the Obama administration has not treated Britain with the kind of respect America\u2019s closest friend and ally deserves to be treated.\u201d \n \n Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Many of these groups increasingly view Christianity as a foreign, \"colonial\" import, and believe its practitioners are doing the bidding of the West, say experts. \n While Christians continue to be under siege from ISIS radicals in Syria and Iraq, the religion is being targeted throughout the region with members of the faith also under increasing pressure in Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations. \n The Christian population in Iraq alone has plummeted from 1.5 million in 2003 to current estimates of 275,000 and could be gone for good within just a few years, according to activists. The dwindling numbers are due to genocide, refugees fleeing to other countries, those who are internally displaced, and others hiding in plain sight and not allowing their faith to be publicly known. \n \n \n \n \n \n Despite these issues, experts like Mauro say that the faith has continued to flourish despite growing opposition. \n \u201cThe persecution of Christians has failed to suppress the faith,\u201d he said to FoxNews.com. \u201cOn the contrary, Christianity appears to be rapidly growing beneath the surface.

   "7. content": "JK Rowling Sends Potter Books to Seven-Year-Old in Aleppo \n \n Sreepur Children's Village in Bangladesh helps women and children who are homeless or victims of abuse. | Photo: Sreepur Village Facebook \n \n Poverty is relative. The conditions of American poverty, for example, are less severe than the conditions of poverty in Bangladesh. \n This is not to say that we should ignore the plight of impoverished Americans. We must prioritize efforts to enable poor Americans to build better lives. A nation as rich and as great as ours should never accept avoidable human suffering as \u201cbad luck.\u201d \n Yet we should also pay heed to global efforts against poverty. In doing so, we can learn lessons and find inspiration. As  I noted  last year on  Opportunity Lives , the Sreepur Children\u2019s Village in Bangladesh proves how addressing child poverty requires a multi-stage approach. It\u2019s not just about food and shelter; it\u2019s about empowering children to become adults who pursue their own better destinies. \n Watch On Forbes:  Breaking Over The Poverty Line \n \n \n Still, while Sreepur does great work, it recognizes that much more to be done. For one, the village has limited space in its refuge facility, yet Bangladesh has a massive population of homeless children in need. All too often, these children are left to scour dangerous streets and railway tracks in a fight to survive. They are at the mercy of criminal gangs, starvation and abuse. They are also  vulnerable to serious injury . \n And that matters especially in Bangladesh, because poor children are often refused medical treatment. Many hospitals will simply turn children away and leave them to die or suffer serious complications from otherwise straightforward medical concerns. I have seen this tragedy firsthand. Visiting Bangladesh in 1998, I remember seeing the scarred arms of boys in the capital city Dhaka. I later found out that the boys had been injured by sticking their arms into rusting sugar drums. They were starving and their choice was between injury and death. \n \n There is hope, however. To address this crisis of neglect, Sreepur Children\u2019s Village is working to establish a helpline-reaction system. The five-month trial run project will operate in Dhaka and a nearby town, Tongi. But its simplicity is the key. The helpline will be manned 24-hours-a-day and will work with the assistance of local child-support specialists and children themselves. If injured, an individual will be able to call the helpline and receive emergency medical assistance. A caseworker will then ensure that the child is taken to a hospital. Lives will be saved. \n Nevertheless, the program isn\u2019t just about action. It\u2019s about research for the future. The team involved will also record data on each incident. The idea is that by compiling a map and reports on where injuries have occurred and where and how treatment has been delivered, Sreepur will guide future support efforts. In basic terms, if Sreepur and other charities \u2014 and presumably the Bangladeshi government \u2014 know where most injuries are occurring, they\u2019ll be able to target resources more effectively later.  Efficiency is always crucial  in anti-poverty efforts, but it is especially so in nations such as Bangladesh where resources are scarce. \n Sreepur Children\u2019s Village will also focus on leveraging public attention to the suffering of young children. In doing so, the organization hopes to lay a longer-term foundation for child-related anti-poverty efforts by raising money and providing more stable means to those in need. SCV knows that the task at hand is too great for one organization. To truly make a difference, it must build a coalition. \n Whatever the group does, however, many Bangladeshi children will continue to live and suffer without help. But through innovation and commitment, Sreepur Children\u2019s Village hopes to make things better. And in its approach \u2014 acting immediately but gathering data for the long term \u2014 the charity offers a fine example for others around the world.

Now, it resembles a somewhat post-apocalyptic scene, with rows of cobweb-laced seats, tattered curtains and projectors which, remarkably, still work.    Photographer and technology teacher Dax Ward, 36, who is based in Bangkok, visited the crumbling destination in December 2016.   'The roof is caving in, dust and dirt has gathered on the seats and the floors have been washed away by flooding,' he remarks. 'But for the most part, all of the elements of a working movie theatre still remain.   'In many ways it's as if the last film stopped rolling, the audience got up from their seats and walked out, the doors were locked and the place has sat in state for 30 years.'    Mr Ward met the owners of the property, who said they tried every tactic to help the business succeed or make a comeback - but they didn't succeed.   Mr Ward continues: 'The outside of the building is fairly unremarkable. It just looks like a large building or warehouse with no signage or other evidence of what is inside.   'Tourists don't go here - the town is very off the beaten path - about 40 minutes away from the main sights and lodgings in Sukhotai.'   Mr Ward believes that Thailand is a goldmine for abandoned locations and will continue to explore the hidden territories it has to offer.   'I've shot five abandoned theatres in the past few months and this one is the only one that still has the seats, screen and even projectors,' he says.   'It's a real gem. I'm really happy with these photos.   'It's a location with a truly unique atmosphere and I just hope that my pictures caught some of that.'",

'We're on the cusp of hopefully being able to prevent a large number of cases of peanut allergy,' said Dr. Matthew Greenhawt of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, a member of the NIH-appointed panel that wrote the guidelines.   Babies at high risk \u2014 because they have a severe form of the skin rash eczema or egg allergies \u2014 need a check-up before any peanut exposure, and might get their first taste in the doctor's office.   For other tots, most parents can start adding peanut-containing foods to the diet much like they already introduced oatmeal or mushed peas.   No, babies don't get whole peanuts or a big glob of peanut butter \u2014 those are choking hazards. Instead, the guidelines include options like watered-down peanut butter or easy-to-gum peanut-flavored 'puff' snacks.   'It's an important step forward,' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which appointed experts to turn the research findings into user-friendly guidelines.    'When you do desensitize them from an early age, you have a very positive effect.'   Peanut allergy is a growing problem, affecting about 2 percent of U.S. children who must avoid the wide array of peanut-containing foods or risk severe, even life-threatening, reactions.   For years, pediatricians advised avoiding peanuts until age 3 for children thought to be at risk. But the delay didn't help, and that recommendation was dropped in 2008 \u2014 although parent wariness of peanuts persists.   'It's old news, wrong old news, to wait,' said Dr. Scott Sicherer, who represented the American Academy of Pediatrics on the guidelines panel.   Thursday's guidelines make that clear, urging parents and doctors to proactively introduce peanut-based foods early.   'Just because your uncle, aunt and sibling have an allergy, that's even more reason to give your baby the food now' \u2014 even if they're already older than 6 months, added Sicherer, a pediatric allergist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.   In Columbus, Ohio, one doctor told Carrie Stevenson to avoid peanuts after her daughter was diagnosed with egg allergy.    Then Stevenson found an allergy specialist who insisted that was the wrong advice \u2014 and offered baby Estelle a taste test of peanut butter in his office when she was 7 months old.   'I was really nervous,' Stevenson recalled, unsure which doctor to believe. But, 'we didn't want her to have any more allergies.'   Now 18 months old, Estelle has eaten peanut butter or peanut-flavored puffs at least three times a week since then and so far seems healthy. Stevenson, pregnant again, plans early exposure for her next child, too.   The guidelines recommend:   What's the evidence? First, researchers noticed a tenfold higher rate of peanut allergy among Jewish children in Britain, who aren't fed peanut products during infancy, compared to those in Israel where peanut-based foods are common starting around age 7 months.   Then in 2015, an NIH-funded study of 600 babies put that theory to the test, assigning them either to avoid or regularly eat age-appropriate peanut products.    By age 5, only 2 percent of peanut eaters \u2014 and 11 percent of those at highest risk \u2014 had become allergic.    Among peanut avoiders, 14 percent had become allergic, and 35 percent of those at highest risk.   Whether the dietary change will spur a drop in U.S. peanut allergies depends on how many parents heed the new advice \u2014 and if a parent seems skeptical, the guidelines urge doctors to follow up.",

Twelve people died and 48 were injured after Amri, who had pledged allegiance to ISIS, hijacked Polish trucker Lukasz Urban's vehicle and steered it into a crowd of shoppers.   He fled to Italy, via Holland, after bungling German police arrested an innocent Pakistani asylum seeker.   Meanwhile it has emerged that the Scania lorry he used to commit the massacre may end up as a ghoulish exhibit at the House of History museum in Bonn.",

Amri was shot dead four days later by Italian police in Milan on December 23 after fleeing Germany.   During a press conference, Gentiloni said: 'Processes of radicalisation today are happening above all in certain places: in prisons and on the web.   'Working on prisons and the web is one of the principal tasks the experts are asking for in this prevention effort.'   Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti added that he wanted a 'protective network against the malware of terror' online, but gave no details on how the government planned to address the problems in jails.    The national prison workers' union said in a statement that jails had become 'a fertile ground' for jihadists to recruit weaker individuals to fight for them.   It added that union members should receive foreign language lessons and courses on religious awareness to better tackle the challenge.   'It is not by chance that many radicalised common criminals, especially of North African origin, who showed no particular religious inclination when they entered prison, are gradually transformed into extremists under the influence of other inmates who are already radicalised,' the union statement.   Italy tried to deport Amri after he served his four-year jail term, but Tunisia refused to take him back and he was released with only an order to leave the country.   Italy has not suffered the type of militant attack seen in France, Belgium and Germany, but has expelled 133 suspected militants in the past two years.   Of more than 27,000 expulsion orders handed out in 2015 to immigrants with no right to stay, fewer than 5,000 were carried out, according to Eurostat.   Italy is already struggling to deal with record numbers of boat migrants arriving mostly from north Africa.   'We need more effective migration policies that combine the great humanitarian inclination to rescue and house people and rigorous and effective repatriation policies,' Gentiloni said.   Commenting on plans to build more detention centres to hold people ahead of deportation, Minniti said he aimed to allocate smaller numbers of migrants to more locations, thereby reducing pressure on overcrowded sites where protests have broken out.   Opposition politicians have criticised Minniti's plan to open more detention centres, a system repeatedly criticised for alleged corruption and human rights abuses.   'It would only slow down expulsions of illegal immigrants and would increase waste, illegality and mafia groups,' said the anti-system 5-Star Movement.   Monday (December 19)   Between 3pm and 4pm: Polish lorry driver Lukasz Urban, 37, has his lorry hijacked. He was on his way back to his truck from a kebab shop when he was ambushed.   8pm - The truck is driven into a large crowd of people at outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the centre of Berlin. Urban's body was found in the passenger seat after the attackers fled. He had been shot and stabbed, but authorities believe he was alive when the truck ploughed into the crowd. Twelve people were killed and 50 more were injured.   9pm - A Pakistani man is arrested a mile-and-a-half from the scene, after witnesses claimed to have seen him leaving the truck. It was revealed that he had entered Germany under a false name in February.   10.16pm - Controversial far-right activist Lutz Bachmann, who heads the anti-immigrant PEGIDA group, tweeted on Monday night that he had 'internal police information' that the perpetrator was a Tunisian.    Tuesday   4am - Police raid a refugee camp at Tempelhof, believed to be where the Pakistani suspect resided.    8am - The suspect is named as Naved B, a 23-year-old man from Pakistan, but police later reveal that the man has denied any involvement in the attack and urged people to be vigilant.   10am - German chancellor Angela Merkel confirms the attack is being treated as an act of terrorism.   12pm - Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, confirms that  18 of the 50 people hurt in the attack were 'very seriously injured'.   1.20pm - Police admit that they have arrested the wrong man. A senior officer says: 'The true perpetrator is still armed, at large and can cause fresh damage.'   6.50pm - Authorities confirm that the wrongly-arrested man has been released.   ISIS claims responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement which describes the lorry driver as a 'soldier' and praised him for 'targeting nationals of the coalition countries'.   Wednesday   It is revealed that police are looking for a Tunisian man, named as Anis Amri, after his ID was found under the driver's seat. It emerged that the failed asylum seeker, who had a 100,000 euro reward on his head, had been under the surveillance of German intelligence for several months, and  had been arrested three times this year, but deportation papers were never served. Reports in Germany suggest intelligence services had lost track of him weeks ago.   A cousin of Naveed Baluch, the wrongly accused suspect, was 'mentally unfit' and had not been heard from since he was released. His cousin Waheed told MailOnline he was 'very worried' about the missing man.    Thursday   An Israeli woman became the first named victim of the Berlin lorry massacre. Dalia Elyakim, from Herzliya, Israel, was with her husband Rami when the atrocity happened. Rami was in hospital fighting for his life.    The market where the massacre happened reopened, with heightened security. Stalls on Breitscheidplatz square opened again three days after the 25-tonne lorry was used as a weapon to kill and maim shoppers.    Two of Amri\u2019s brothers, Walid and Abdelkader, said they believed he had been radicalised in prison in Italy, and Abdelkader told reporers: 'I ask him to turn himself in to the police. If it is proved that he is involved, we dissociate ourselves from it.'   Two men were arrested after a police raid at a mosque in Berlin's Moabit neighbourhood, where Amri was allegedly captured on CCTV just eight hours after the mass killing.   Friday   3am - Amri was shot dead in Milan. He immediately produced a gun when approached by police. In a press conference at 9.45am, the Italian Interior minister, Marco Minniti, said Amri immediately produced a gun when approached by police and shot an officer during a routine patrol. The Tunisian was then killed, and there is 'absolutely no doubt' that the man was Amri, Minniti said.   It has emerged that German police are linking Amri to the murder of a 16-year-old German boy in Hamburg two months ago. ISIS claimed responsibility for the October 16 knife attack which killed the teenager, identified by authorities as Victor E. He has also previously been jailed in his native Tunisia for hijacking a truck.   Saturday   Authorities in Tunisia announce that three men, including Amri's 18-year-old nephew, have been arrested in connection with a terror cell believed to be linked to the Berlin truck killer.",

'It often happens that I'm interrupted by urgent problems in my free time, or need to reply to emails out of hours,' she told AFP, asking for her real name and her company's not to be used.    Since January 1, French companies with more than 50 employees must work up a charter defining employees' right to switch off. No sanctions are foreseen for non-compliance but an employee could sue for having their rights infringed.   The new labour law in a country famous for its tightly regulated workplace was prompted by the blurring of the boundary between work and private life by new technology and ways of working.    'No one forces me to do it, but I get work email on my telephone and other managers have the same thing,' Beatrice added.      Requests from Beatrice's team of six intruded frequently into a recent holiday, meaning she couldn't switch off as she would have liked.   'I could have said \"I don't care\", but then it puts other people in difficulty,' she confided.   While generally aware of potential health problems for employees, the company is trying hard to cut costs, she says. The result is senior managers want the same outcome with fewer people.    Yet others believe that it is not simply over-demanding bosses that are to blame for them checking mail during dinner or before going to bed, illustrating the difficulty of regulating how people work in their own time.   Some confess that their own work ethic and ambition spurs them on, or simply a lack of willpower to ignore unopened mail.   Mathilde, a 26-year-old employee of a cultural agency in the Opera area of central Paris, says she over-checks her messages due to curiosity rather than pressure.   'If there was an expectation (that I'd reply), then it would make me anxious,' she told AFP.   A hard-charging young banker who works on mergers and acquisitions says his employer cuts access to work email for his team from 10pm to 6am every night to prevent over-work.   'It's a choice whether you check your phone or not. Telling me I have to switch off p****s me off,' the 24-year-old admitted before striding off in his suit.    Peter Fleming, an expert on the workplace at the University of London, says many employees suffer from the 'hard-work culture' of their companies, but also an 'obsessive attachment to their work identity.'   'For many people, a job has moved from something we do and become something that we are,' he told AFP. '24/7 email really amplifies that trend.'   Company-wide policies on disconnecting - whether prompted by the law in France or by companies themselves elsewhere - are therefore welcome and in some cases necessary.   Fleming says the ambitious MBA business students at his university would be instinctively opposed to disconnecting out-of-hours because they would be worried about being judged harshly.   'It has to be collective, not individual. If I know that all my co-workers aren't connected, then I might not be too,' he said.   People working in the finance, technology, law or health professions are seen as particularly vulnerable to the risks of overload and burnout, but an increasing number of top companies are waking up to the risks.    It is no coincidence that telecom group Orange was asked to help draft France's 'right to disconnect' legislation after a scandal over 35 suicides among its workforce between 2008 and 2009.   The company, working with trade unions, drew up new guidance on disconnecting in September, three months before the law came into force, group human resources director Jerome Barre told AFP.   Orange's 150,000 employees now benefit from a promise they will not be penalised for failing to check email out of the office. Everyone is discouraged from sending messages outside working hours.   Managers are being trained to understand that 'if a boss sends an email in the middle of the weekend his employees will feel obliged to reply', Barre said.   At the same time, no one is prevented from catching up on work at home and the rules contain flexibility for people who work remotely or unusual hours.   'If in my personal way of working it's more comfortable for me to finish something at the weekend, we can't ban it,' Barre explained.   'But I don't necessarily have to send the result of my work on Sunday night. It can wait until Monday morning.'",

Seeing him as a man of action, Mr Zawiti has designed the restaurant's logo showing Mr Trump with a lightning bolt hairstyle.    Trump Fish opened last month in Dohuk, which is only an hour's drive from Mosul, where Kurdish peshmergas and Iraqi soldiers are trying to dislodge ISIS.    Mr Zawiti admitted he chose the name as a gimmick which he hoped would boost trade but said it came after Trump praised the peshmerga and called for them to be given US arms supplies.    He said: 'I personally love Trump for this. The name Trump is beloved in Kurdistan.'   But Mr Zawiti said some online critics have accused him of being an American or Israeli agent and have threatened him because of the name.    The Kurds have carved out their own de facto state in northern Iraq in the wake of the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.   The peshmerga - whose name literally means 'those who face death' - have proven to be brave fighters who have helped to turn the tide against ISIS.   Some customers upset with Trump's campaign pledge to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States boycotted the restaurant.    Mr Zawiti, who runs Trump Fish with his three brothers, said the business is still not making a profit but he hopes to emulate the wealth of his tycoon hero.   Masgouf is a grilled fish farmed in local rivers and seasoned with olive oil, pepper, lemon and spices.   One customer who enjoyed the food, if not the name, was American visitor David Hirsch, who said: 'He is an American, maybe he is not my favourite, but he is still American. So I'm happy to try a restaurant with an American name with Kurdish-Iraqi food.'   Mr Zawiti even hopes to bring Trump Fish to America, and chuckled: 'Give me a visa and I will go tomorrow.'",

The show culminated with them smashing glass bottles on their heads without any visible effect.   After the display, eager Filipinos rushed to take 'selfies' with the beret-wearing Russians.   'The performances were great, the stunts were quite impressive,' gushed student Antonio Chua.   The visit was spearheaded by two warships following Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's announced pivot away from the United States.       Filipinos were also allowed to attend an open house on the submarine-hunter Admiral Tributs, one of the two ships making what was only the Russian Navy's third-ever port call in the Philippines.   Duterte, who calls himself a socialist, has championed a move away from the United States and towards US rivals Russia and China following American criticism of his bloody war on crime that has claimed thousands of lives.   'America has lost,' Duterte said on a visit to China in October last year.   'I've realigned myself in your (Chinese) ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to (President Vladimir) Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world: China, Philippines and Russia. It's the only way.'   Russia's ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev said Thursday he expected a planned visit by Duterte to Russia in April or May to be 'a milestone'.   'It will be a very successful visit that will give a powerful impetus (to our) cooperation in different fields,' Khovaev told reporters at the Marines' display.",

Gibraltar police retraced the route of the chase and picked up 27 bales of hashish resin while the Guardia Civil found another seven.   The drugs weighed around 800 kilos and are estimated to have a street value of \u00a34,050,000 (4,762,000 euros).   The Royal Gibraltar Police said in a statement: 'This highlights the close cooperation that exists not just among local law enforcement agencies, but also with the Guardia Civil in combating crime, particularly drug trafficking, across the Straits of Gibraltar.'   Drugs, especially hashish, are often smuggled across the Straits of Gibraltar from Morocco, although in recent years the human trafficking trade has almost eclipsed the drugs business.   Madrid ceded Gibraltar in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht.    The territory remains a source of Anglo-Spanish tensions, with Madrid long claiming it should be returned to Spanish sovereignty. But the majority of Gibraltarians have always said they want to remain British citizens.   While Spanish and Gibraltar police cooperate regularly at the grass roots level, there are often flare-ups between the two sides over jurisdiction and sovereignty.   Gibraltar says Spanish vessels regularly stray deep into its territorial waters and Britain's Foreign Office has attacked such incidents as provocative.   In the most serious recent incident, a British navy patrol boat fired flares to warn off a survey ship operated by Spain's Oceanographic Institute which had entered disputed waters.",

   "7. content": "Gout sufferers should eat baked beans on toast to tackle the painful condition, new research revealed today.   Experts said a diet high in fibre, such as beans, wholemeal bread, rice and jacket potatoes, can also cut arthritis pain.   Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory joint disease in men over 40 years old and one in 10 older people in the UK suffer gout.   It is an inflammatory arthritis triggered by a crystallised uric acid within the joints that causes severe pain and swelling.   The condition is often mistakenly believed to be caused by drinking too much red wine, with older, over-weight men most at risk.   While treatments are available, gout patients are often hit by recurring gout attacks, prompting patients and doctors to investigate other preventive options.   Now a team has found that high fibre diets reduce inflammation caused by gout, severely reducing pain.   Researchers from the University of Minas Gerais in Brazil found that diets high in fibre trigger microorganisms in the gut to produce fatty acids, which cut inflammation linked to gout and arthritis.   They said the findings, published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology, have important implications for the treatment of gout and possibly for the treatment of arthritis.   Study co-author Dr Mauro Teixeira said:'By understanding the way foods interact with living organisms, we may be able to create diets that help people with the disease, as well as their health overall.'   To make their discovery, scientists used a high-fibre diet and treatment with fatty acids to prevent inflammation associated with the injection of crystals in the knees of mice.   Laboratory experiments showed that this not only reduced inflammation but also boosted the production of anti-inflammation compounds in the knee joint, preventing further knee damage and dysfunction.   Dr John Wherry, deputy editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology, said: 'We are seeing an explosion in our understanding of how microbial communities in our intestines and elsewhere influence multiple aspects of immune and metabolic health.   'This work is a good example of how tuning of inflammatory circuits by linking diet to microbial products can have a profound effect on an inflammatory disease in the joints.   'Future work may allow such findings to be translated into practical treatments for gout and other diseases.'",

   "7. content": "US President-elect Donald Trump. (Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n I am going to be as honest with readers as I am to people who come up to me in person. I honestly don\u2019t know what to make of Donald Trump as President. There are clearly hints as to the broad direction he wishes to take on certain policies, but so much of these hints and tweets are enigmatic. Is he blowing smoke or is he for real? \n First and foremost, let\u2019s dismiss the fact that the Republicans control both houses of Congress so the first 100 Days of the Trump Era will be a honeymoon. This looks more to me like the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard and Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie marriages than a love fest. So Mr. Trump wants a big tax cut, as does the GOP, but already the Congressional leadership is asking who will pay for this? They won\u2019t, it appears, reduce taxes without concomitant budget cuts \u2013 something sure to get blowback from a new President who feels the need to be listed as among the greatest Presidents of all time \u2013 or he will lose interest. Both sides want and need an infrastructure bill, something Mr. Trump promised, but again Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to not consider one unless it is paid dollar for dollar with budget cuts. \n Obamacare is first on the list to be repealed, but we already know about this saga of \u201crepeal\u201d (the easy part) vs. \u201creplace\u201d (something that the GOP has promised for 8 years and has not come up with yet). Mr. Trump appears to be alone among his \u201cfellow Republicans\u201d (a term that also shows sharp disagreement among party leaders and members) by wanting to keep some key provisions of the Affordable Care Act. \n \n And then there is Mr. Trump and Russia and the intelligence community. Once again, the President-elect is at odds with senior figures in his own party \u2013 just as he was during his campaign. While a President, by the Constitution, has the sole authority to conduct foreign policy and diplomacy \u2013 and to change the direction of both as he sees fit \u2013 it can be very different if there is strong opposition from powerful Congressional leaders and from the lifers within the State Department. Just ask Woodrow Wilson, who never got his League of Nations, and Barack Obama, whose \u201cred line\u201d in Syria moved back and back\u2026 and back. \n Now Congressional leaders also recognize that they have to govern and need to, in a piece of jargon that I hate, \u201cput points on the board\u201d \u2013 but there has been little love within the GOP itself. The House foolishly voted to strip the independent Ethics Committee even though this flaky move was strongly opposed by the man they had just re-elected as their Speaker. Within 24 hours, a tweet from Mr. Trump and a backlash from their own constituents forced them to back off that move. But what a way for Congress to start their first day of power. \n \n Finally, we can look at the (mostly) men that are being nominated for Cabinet positions. On the surface we see Mr. Trump\u2019s devotion to nonrenewable fuels, depth of opposition to Obamacare, challenge to global warming science, commitment to charter schools \u2013 and more traditional conservative Holy Grails. On the other hand, we also see a new Secretary of State designate who favors a carbon tax, support from the President-elect for at least some key provisions of Obamacare, and a backing away from the size of his border wall and the numbers of deportees. And then there is Ivanka \u2013 the resident \u201cliberal\u201d in the mix. \n In short, don\u2019t be fooled by facile predictions about what will happen. We witnessed that during the campaign, didn\u2019t we?",

The academics deliver a devastating verdict on the Treasury\u2019s pre-referendum scare-mongering, accusing officials of \u2018flawed and partisan\u2019 forecasts about the country\u2019s prospects outside the EU.   The Treasury was accused of a Project Fear cover-up last night after refusing to identify the economists who predicted an immediate recession if Britain voted for Brexit.   Cabinet minister David Gauke has refused repeated Parliamentary requests to identify the officials who were responsible for the doom-mongering predictions.   This is despite concerns from MPs that the same economists are working on the Brexit negotiations and may take excessively gloomy positions that hold Britain back. Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen has asked Parliamentary questions and written in person to Mr Gauke, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, requesting the names of the senior economists responsible, all of whom are paid by the taxpayer.   He wrote: \u2018I do feel in the light of the economic performance after the referendum, a full list of the economists who contributed to Treasury review should be made public given the significant impact the report could have had on the referendum.   \u2018I believe this is necessary if the public is to have confidence in Treasury reports in the future.\u2019   But Mr Gauke would only confirm the documents were produced internally by the Treasury.       Instead, they say leaving the Brussels club will allow net migration \u2013 the difference between the number of foreign nationals arriving in the UK and those leaving \u2013 to be cut to 165,000. The total currently stands at a record 330,000.   The report came as a raft of economic good news emerged yesterday including record car sales, a fresh high for the FTSE and a report showing that business confidence is returning.    The Cambridge study, from its Centre for Business Research, said slashing net migration would give British workers more wage bargaining power while reducing the pressure on housing supply.   It said: \u2018Controls on immigration from the EU are assumed to be imposed in mid-2019, leading to net migration falling to around 165,000 from 2020.\u2019    On wages, the report states: \u2018Our equations for earnings suggest that earnings will rise by more than 2 per cent as employment rates reach a peak in 2017 and especially as migration reduces from 2019.   \u2018The UK labour market has become very dependent on foreign-born labour with the increase in foreign-born workers being equivalent to over 80 per cent of additional employment since 2004.   \u2018Immigration restrictions will provide the biggest shock to wage bargaining for over a decade.\u2019   The Treasury\u2019s doom-laden report predicted a fall in real wages, which factors in rising inflation.   By contrast, the CEBR predicts they will keep rising in line with inflation until around 2025. From then on, there will be steady real-terms rises.    On housing, it says \u2013 without Brexit \u2013 homes would have become much harder to afford as prices far outstripped wage growth.   The report states: \u2018With lower net migration after 2019 this pressure is expected to recede.\u2019   The report said that only one of the Treasury\u2019s many gloomy predictions \u2013 a sharp fall in sterling \u2013 had been realised.    The economists said even this had a positive impact because it would reduce the UK\u2019s balance of payments deficit to a \u2018manageable level\u2019.   He's  obviously feline the benefits of post-Brexit Britain.   Number 10 cat Larry was spotted with a new collar yesterday featuring a union flag pattern. The Downing Street mouse catcher was treated to the patriotic gift over the festive period \u2013 most likely a present from a civil servant.     Crucially, the fall in the pound has also effectively wiped out the impact of any tariffs which may be imposed on UK exports by the EU once Brexit is complete. For 2017, the economists predict growth of GDP will be between one and 1.5 per cent and \u2018could even be 2 per cent\u2019.   Graham Gudgin, one of the authors of the report, said the Treasury\u2019s work had been \u2018very flawed and very partisan\u2019.    \u2018The Treasury said there would be four quarters of recession, we have had six months since the Brexit vote, we should have been in recession by now, but we are not,\u2019 he said.   Overall, the study says of the economy: \u2018The economic outlook is grey rather than black, but this would, in our view, have been the case with or without Brexit.\u2019   Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said: \u2018The Treasury was far too pessimistic about Brexit - and constantly far too optimistic about the alleged benefits of the EU single market.    \u2018Long term, I don\u2019t think Brexit is going to have any negative effect.\u2019    Figures released yesterday revealed car sales hit a record high last year as families brushed off doom-laden warnings about the threat posed by Brexit.   Some 2.69million new cars were sold in the UK in 2016 \u2013 up from 2.63million the previous year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.   In a further boost to the economy, the FTSE hit a new record high for the fifth trading day in a row \u2013 a first since January 1998.   A report by the British Chambers of Commerce also shows business confidence is returning as the fall in the pound helps exports.   BCC director general Adam Marshall said: \u2018Our findings suggest that business communities across the UK remain resilient, and many firms are expecting continued growth in the months ahead.\u2019   Separately, analysts IHS Markit said its index of activity in the construction sector \u2013 where scores above 50 show growth \u2013 rose from 52.8 in November to 54.2 in December.",

   "7. content": "Tony Blair  yesterday announced he is ploughing almost \u00a310million into his new crusade against 'populists'.   The former Prime Minister has vowed to use his riches and influence to fight Brexit and stop Britain quitting the  European Union .   He is winding up his secretive money-making empire and setting up the Tony Blair Institute, a not-for-profit organisation entirely owned by him.   Yesterday, as his firms' annual accounts were published, he revealed he is giving \u00a39.3million from his companies to the new institute, whose purpose will be to tackle 'the new populism' which he said was driving the world apart on Brexit and other issues.   But as usual, Mr Blair's accounts do not reveal how much money he has taken for himself on his 'final payday' before he starts working for free.   The complex web of companies \u2013 named Windrush and Firerush - was set up ten years ago in such a way that it is impossible to see what he earned.   However the accounts do offer a clue that profits may have risen significantly in the past year.   From the limited information available, a firm named Windrush Ventures No. 3 appears to be the real money-maker for Mr Blair.    Because it is a 'limited partnership', it is not obliged to make public its profits.   Yet the accounts show that this firm was able to pay out a share of profits worth \u00a33.2million to other Windrush companies \u2013 a 42 per cent increase on a similar profit share paid last year.   It was also able to pay out nearly \u00a315million to other Windrush companies for admin services.   Mr Blair has pledged to work for nothing at his new institute. His office said yesterday: 'On his instruction, the articles of association stipulate that he will not receive any salary or remuneration for this role.'   The millionaire ex-Labour leader has previously suggested he is not worth more than \u00a320million, even though he and his wife Cherie own 38 properties worth more than \u00a332million.   When he announced last September that he was winding down his Windrush and Firerush companies, after years of raking in millions of pounds from foreign despots, Mr Blair claimed he wanted to concentrate on charity work.    The dramatic move was interpreted as a desperate bid to salvage his reputation, shortly after it was trashed by the Chilcot report into the Iraq war. But critics suggested that he had simply made so much money, he did not need any more.   Now Mr Blair says he is returning to the Westminster stage to 'play at least a small part' in shaping the UK's future.   He says his new institute will 'inform and support' political leaders, but insists he is not looking for office himself.   He has said: 'This is not about my returning to the front line of politics. I have made it abundantly clear that this is not possible.   'However, I care about my country and the world my children and grandchildren will grow up in; and want to play at least a small part in contributing to the debate about the future of both.' His first grandchild was born in October.   In recent weeks, Mr Blair, 63, has been holding clandestine meetings with like-minded 'progressives' such as former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg to draw up plans aimed at keeping Britain in the EU.   In November, he declared that Brexit 'can be stopped' because he said many Leave supporters would change their minds once they realised the economic case 'doesn't stack up'.   Explaining his new not-for-profit institute, Mr Blair said it was 'not a think tank', but 'a platform for engagement to inform and support the practising politician'.   It would 'build a new policy agenda for the centre ground' with networks to link people together.   He said: 'It is what I know I would want, were I still in the frontline of politics. Part of its focus will plainly be around the European debate; but this will not be its exclusive domain. It has to go far wider than that since in many ways the Europe debate is a lightning rod for the whole of politics.'",

(Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images) \n \n Candidate Hillary Clinton uncharacteristically decried \u201cRussian subversion\u201d during the campaign. She called opponent Donald Trump a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. In so doing, the Clinton team unleashed a wave of unsubstantiated accusations\u2014about which the intelligence community remains divided \u2014 that Putin wanted Trump to win the election. This has morphed into a widespread misperception that the Russians \u201chacked\u201d the election itself. \n Clinton\u2019s allegations of Russian subversion must undergo the most rigorous investigation. Trump should welcome a comprehensive probe. \n Watch On Forbes:  Linkedin Is Now Officially Blocked In Russia \n \n \n But limiting the scope of \u201cRussian subversion\u201d to the 2016 campaign is a trap. Trump must raise the ante. He must broaden any investigation to cover  all  foreign subversion of American politics and policies. It\u2019s time to drain the fetid swamp of foreign espionage, subversion and corruption aimed at compromising decision-makers in Washington. \n \n Congress must do the same. For almost 60 years after our involvement in World War I, Congress had bipartisan, standing committees and subcommittees to investigate foreign-sponsored subversion that manipulated or undermined our democracy. Congress shut them down in the 1970s and never replaced them. Occasionally a congressional panel would hold hearings about \u201cactive measures,\u201d as the Soviets called their political warfare technique, welcoming classified and unclassified testimony from the FBI and CIA and an occasional outside expert, but generally Congress pretended not to see the problem and surrendered its investigative role to the intelligence community. Private-sector support for continued research and reporting practically dried up. \n Documentation and testimony from those old congressional hearings and reports, defector accounts and internal Soviet documents unearthed over the past 25 years show that the Kremlin tried to influence or manipulate the American political process in every presidential election from 1924 to 1952, and from 1968 to 1988. It did so by directly and indirectly funding American political and policy groups amid relentless active measures, campaigns and espionage offensives. \n \n \n Edward Snowden speaks via video link at a news conference for the launch of a campaign calling for President Obama to pardon him on September 14, 2016 in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \n \n The nation can come to no conclusive understanding of whether or how Moscow tried to manipulate the recent elections \u2014 and decades of foreign and defense policy \u2014 unless it re-learns the bigger picture and historical context. \n By expanding the investigative focus, we can learn from cases like the FBI\u2019s Operation Ghost Stories, a brilliant, decade-long effort that broke up a network of deep-cover Russian spies in 2010. The agents\u2019 assignment was to get close to influential American academic, business and political figures. Mostly under false identities, the agents lived as normal-looking Americans. Russian tradecraft terms them \u201cillegals\u201d because they went without diplomatic protection. The network of 11 known illegals operated primarily in the Boston-New York-Washington, D.C. corridor, with the heaviest concentration in New York City. \n One of the Russian spies, federal prosecutors said, worked as a financial advisor to the 2008 presidential campaign chairman of then-senator Hillary Clinton. Another was connected to a New York-based confidant of an unnamed \u201ccabinet member\u201d in 2009 whose identity, though redacted from declassified Justice Department documents, was understood to be then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton. The purpose of the massive intelligence operation may not have been only to steal secrets. Like some of Moscow\u2019s most successful human intelligence coups, a purpose may have been to subvert American decision-making at crucial times. \n When the FBI wrapped up the network on June 27, 2010, after one of the illegals escaped, Clinton moved with unusual speed over an extended Independence Day weekend to whisk the remaining ten spies back to Russia. On July 9, a Friday, the U.S. swapped them in Vienna, Austria for four Russians who had been convicted of spying for the United States. \n Clinton\u2019s office pooh-poohed the magnitude of the Russian illegals operation. \u201cThere is no reason to believe that the secretary of state was a special target of this spy ring,\u201d Clinton spokesman P.J. Crowley said at the time. \n Senator Chuck Schumer, the outspoken New York Democrat whose job on the Judiciary Committee is to oversee U.S. counterintelligence, also showed little concern. He expressed no interest in doing a damage assessment of Russian penetration, whether of America itself or the political machine in his home state. Few in the Republican-controlled Congress made much an issue of either the spying or Clinton\u2019s cavalier attitude toward it. Everyone seemed to forget about the matter. It didn\u2019t come up in the 2016 campaign. \n Operation Ghost Stories and other cases help us understand the foreign subversion threat. Congress and the executive branch must spare no effort to get to the bottom of hacking American institutions and subverting or manipulating our politicians. But the recent proposal of Senators Schumer and John McCain (R-AZ) to restrict the investigation to this election\u2019s campaign-related cyber espionage won\u2019t safeguard the nation\u2019s interests. Investigations need to go broad and deep. Both houses of Congress should create new, bipartisan standing committees to investigate, hold hearings and report on all foreign subversion in the U.S.\u2014not only from Russia but from any foreign individual, government or movement. Such a call should elicit widespread resistance from special interests dependent on foreign sources of cash, which is exactly the point. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gallery \n     \n Russia Under Putin -- The Third Time Around \n \n Launch Gallery \n \n       13 images \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n As part of making America great again, the Trump administration must smack down foreign covert political warfare once and for all. It should instruct the entire intelligence community to prepare a definitive annual National Intelligence Estimate, or NIE, to reach the most accurate professional consensus on the scope and cumulative effects of foreign subversion of the United States and its allies. The NIE timeframe should begin at least as far back as the longest-serving federal official has been in office. Separately, Trump should assemble an interagency task force to develop a strategy to identify, monitor and neutralize foreign propaganda, political warfare and subversion from any source. A special hybridized team should provide the president with effective strategies and methods of deterrence and retaliation. \n Trump should handle America\u2019s foreign adversaries the way he treats some of his personal opponents: through the specter or acts of  exposure, humiliation and destruction . This is where Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and others are especially vulnerable. An easy, off-the-shelf tool is the Magnitsky Act, which the U.S. has used to put the financial squeeze on individual figures close to the Kremlin. The best way to check against foreign misbehavior is to squeeze the ruling inner circles financially. That will make powerful oligarchs pay high personal prices for their regimes\u2019 meddling in American internal affairs, and incentivize them to pressure their leaders to become more accommodating to the new American leadership.",

The department spent nearly \u00a33,000 this autumn on bizarre sessions that use 'improvisational theatre' techniques to defuse clashes.   The training comes amid signs of tensions within Theresa May's top team over how to approach the looming divorce negotiations with Brussels.   Chancellor Philip Hammond has been advocating caution and stressing the importance of access to the EU market for the economy.   He has suggested a transitional deal may be needed after we formally leave the bloc.   But other Cabinet ministers are thought to be keen to take a tougher line - including Brexit Secretary David Davis and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox.   There have already been bitter clashes with Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is demanding Scotland stays in the EU single market even if the rest of the UK leaves.    Mrs May is also facing difficult questions over whether to pay a 'divorce' settlement demand from the EU that could be as much as \u00a360billion.    Any suggestion that Britain should continue to contribute to Brussels coffers after we formally cut ties is likely to be met with a furious response.   Shadow Cabinet Office minister Ian Lavery said: 'The Cabinet Office is responsible for coordinating the Prime Minister's policies and making sure her priorities are well understood and enacted by every Whitehall department.    'It's their job to deal with the daily arguments and conflicts that occur as a result.    'The fact Cabinet Office staff are themselves receiving conflict resolution training suggests there is a serious malfunction at the heart of government.    According to the transparency logs at the department - which provides support for the PM - three payments of \u00a3960 each were made to attend Together London conferences in October.   The sessions are likely to have taken place later in the year. It is not clear what staff were involved in the training.   The website for the organisation, which is run by guru Jonathan Kahn, states that it 'helps teams to reframe differences of perspective as gifts that enable learning and collaboration'.   'At our events people learn to create safe spaces using techniques from facilitation, conflict resolution, and improvisational theatre,\u201d the website adds.",

Enemies thought him na\u00efve and weak. Friends didn\u2019t trust him. Everyone else just tried to squeeze what they could out of the relationship. \n To put it mildly, President Trump vows a different posture towards Israel and the UN. Tough love is needed in New York and Trump is well-positioned to lead a new effort to make the UN more effective, more transparent and more cost efficient. Thanks to Obama\u2019s go-along to get-along policy with the United Nations and the outrage at his use of the Security Council to retaliate against Israel, he leaves President Trump with perhaps the best opportunity for UN reform any President has had in decades. \n \n \n Members of the UN Security Council vote on a Russian-Turkish peace plan for Syria, on December 31, 2016 / AFP / KENA BETANCUR \n \n \n Simply cutting off the UN from American donor dollars, as some have suggested, might be gratifying but the more constructive goal would be to rally the nations that supply the UN with the lion\u2019s share of its resources and promote a serious reform program tying those resources to long-overdue systemic changes. \n The UN was created by nation-states and it needs to be responsive to nation-states.  The longstanding dynamic in Turtle Bay has seen the Secretariat and the bureaucracy behaving as though the nation-states were responsive to the organization rather than the other way around. It\u2019s just another way the UN, for all its potential and value, has failed to provide the world\u2019s citizens with a strong confidence in the efficacy and honesty of its institutions. \n \n Presently the taxpayers of the United States pay more than $7 billion to the UN through a combination of an annual, mandatory assessment based on a percentage of GDP and other contributions. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask what we\u2019re getting for our investment and demand greater accountability. \n Watch On Forbes:  Donald Trump Pledges To Rip Up Iran Deal; Israelis Say Not So Fast \n \n \n Right now if you\u2019re the United States, being in the UN is like going to a restaurant and ordering wine.  When you get the bill, you\u2019re charged $1000 for the bottle, but you 1. Never saw the bottle so you can\u2019t verify you drank what you ordered; 2. You didn\u2019t really like the wine; and 3. It turns out you\u2019re also footing the bill for virtually everyone else in the restaurant. \n Much like his campaign to upend the Republican establishment, Trump\u2019s United Nations reform program must be undertaken from the outside-in rather from the inside-out. The Secretariat\u2019s intimate involvement in the process of reform along with the inclusion in those efforts of blocs of nations that provide little to no funding for the world body has long stymied substantive efforts and ensured the status quo. \n To be sure, the UN Secretariat is not an executive branch with the member states serving as co-equal legislators. The Secretariat is there to serve as a facilitator of the agenda of the global community expressed by the UN\u2019s members through its various organs. \n It is precisely for this reason that the discussion on UN reform in the Trump era, which has long been debated in New York, should move beyond the walls of the UN to the national parliaments and heads of state and government who appropriate the organization\u2019s funds to begin with. A coalition of just the United States, Brazil, Canada, the UK (now divorced from the EU) Australia, and Japan, would represent more than 40% of the total annual assessment, keeping in mind that 135 of the UN\u2019s 193 member states pay less than .1% of the budget each. \n Taking the push for reform to the very source of the funding and tying those funds to a reform agenda could at long last force acquiescence of the Secretariat and real action within the world body. \n Additional transparency and reforms to peacekeeping operations generally have been debated for decades as well but little progress has been made. Consider that when it comes to the UN\u2019s peacekeeping efforts, just combining the shares of the United States (28.57%), Japan (9.68%), Italy (3.75%), Canada (2.92%), the United Kingdom (5.80%) and Australia (2.33%) accounts for more than 50% of the total budget.",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \n \n The  Washington Post 's Dan Balz  reported  on the political elites confronting Trump,\"As one former member of Obama's campaign team put it, 'I feel like in some ways my brain has to think differently than it ever has.'\" True fact. \n The most vocal of the left's political elites, still navigating K\u00fcbler-Ross's stages of grief, ties itself in knots trying to lay tactical blame for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss. That's \"denial, anger, and bargaining.\" More pragmatic figures on the left are moving on to \"acceptance,\" trying to rethink the legacy political paradigm which Donald Trump has shredded. \n How to \"think differently?\" \n Here's a pretty compelling hypothesis. Trump has fused paleoconservatism with populism, emerging as the founding father of paleopopulism. \n \n Paleoconservatism -- the \u201cOld Right\u201d -- calls for smallish government, militarily strong but not interventionist, with policies such as lower tax rates and smart regulation based on a solid economic cost/benefit analysis. Conjoin all that with active respect for traditional values such as the traditional Judaeo-Christian moral creed. \n Populism calls for putting the government on the side of working people rather than the privileged elites. It commands policies that foment, in practice, vibrant job creation, economic security through honest labor, and upward worker mobility in a climate of equitable prosperity. \n \n Trump won based on the fusion of these two potent messages plus an optimistic attitude toward our ability to make America great again. None of these alone proved sufficient for victory. Together: \"United We Stand.\" Great in theory. \n Yogi Berra once observed that \"in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is.\" Can Trump pull this off in practice? Can Trump, with smart policy design, sell his agenda to a likely recalcitrant Republican Congress and make it work? The perpetuation and extension of the fragile Republican hegemony hinges on his succeeding. \n The Militant Left appears to be in a state of panic that implies a sense of its impending doom. The progressives, owning the high ground inside the Democratic Party, are now preparing, via  Keith Ellison , to double down on the formula that cost them  over a 1,000 net elected offices , nationally, over Obama's tenure. \n A secret ingredient for the left's magic formula has been Calamity Jane politics. That bears reexamination. \n A compelling Narrative of a threat of catastrophic proportions tends to justify almost any political means, however dubious or even shady, to Save The World. Grandiose drama is a political strategy. It used to work. One is reminded of Newt Gingrich, at the peak of his power, telling Gail Sheehy, for  Vanity Fair : \n \n \u2019I think you can write a psychological profile of me that says I found a way to immerse my insecurities in a cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to.\u2019 Newt Gingrich is coaching me on writing about himself. Ten years ago he was arguably the most disliked member of Congress. Today he is holding forth from the veranda of the office of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, looking down on the Capitol Mall as if it were the great lawn of his own vast estate. \n \n Props to Gingrich for some unvarnished truth: \u201ca cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to\u201d is a great descriptor of the loopy politics that currently besets America. Yet we may have passed Peak Hysteria. That overheated tactic may be sputtering out. Let's hope so. \n The progressives have thrived, in part, by propounding an apocalyptic view of world affairs that justifies far too much.  Newsweek \u2019s Ryan Bort performed a great public service by providing a nice  roundup  of how the Mainstream Media, following the Militant Progressive Line, has pretty much concluded that 2016 was: The. Worst. Year. Ever. \n \n The media was quick to declare 2016 the Worst Year Ever.   Slate  and  The Telegraph   started way back in July. Other sites followed, like  The Washington Post ,   BuzzFeed ,   Daily Dot ,  The Wrap ,   Daily Kos  and others. John Oliver said the same on   Last Week Tonight ,   going so far as to blow a prop that read \"2016\" to pieces . It seems that 2016 was so awful that it dethroned the previous Worst Year Ever,  2015 , which dethroned   2014 . I guess if we deem each new year the Worst Ever, then things can only get better, right? \n \n Buzzfeed? More like Buzzkill. (Kudos to  The Washington Post  for  Why 2016 was actually one of the best years on record .) \n To cut the Eeyorish  Newsweek  some slack, it holds that it\u2019s always been horrible: \u201cPretty much every year has been terrible. Life is, for the most part, relentlessly sad and difficult. Maybe some people have had, until recently, the relative privilege to be sheltered from this reality. Good for them.\u201d \n Meanwhile from the emerging paleopopulists and our ilk comes a fascinating counternarrative:  life is getting better . Much better.  In the glow of this real possibility we paleopopulists suspect what we're hearing from the Militant Left is a variant of:  You cursed brat! Look what you\u2019ve done! I\u2019m melting! Melting!   Oh! What a world! What a world! Who would have thought that a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness?  \n Follow along.",

The Cornell Daily Sun   reports   that students, \u201csat in a circle to share stories and console each other, organizers encouraging attendees to gather closer together and \u2018include each other.\u2019\u201d Additionally, students signed posters in protest. \n \n 9.

Why? Because  the presence of campus police is \u201charmful to the campus climate,\u201d  as reported by  The College Fix. \n 6. Gettysburg College Students Sit Down Against Hate \n Students at Gettysburg College gathered in November on the steps of Penn Hall to sit down in protest of hate. In a letter on behalf of the student participants, senior Joseph Charles Recupero III  wrote , \u201cTonight we will sit, because we cannot stand for hate. \u201d The students also apparently slept against hate.  The Gettysburg Recreation Adventure Board (GRAB) gave participants sleeping bags. And they had the chance to meet with the president of the college. Acknowledging that they still had to figure out the next step to destroying hate, Recupero wrote, \n \n To be honest, I am still confused about what to do next. I have gathered all of these people, AMAZING PEOPLE, who simply want to acknowledged as equal, as worth more than the names they call us. Earlier this evening, someone told me that this is the original machine that destroys hate, and behalf of everyone out here, I am extending a hand in partnership.",

Meanwhile, Clinton fell short of Obama\u2019s 2012 popular vote totals by about 70,000. Third party candidates surged from 2.2 million votes in 2012 to just over 7.8 million in 2016. (Download state-by-state data  here .) \n \n \n Visualization by Hamdan Azhar \n \n \n Final results also reveal that despite early claims of historically low turnout, the number of raw votes cast in the 2016 presidential election - 136,628,459 - is actually the highest total  ever . (The previous highest was the 2008 election in which 131.1 million votes were cast.) Even while adjusting for the voting eligible population, Professor Michael McDonald of the University of Florida  estimates  this election had a voter turnout rate of 58.9%. While this is lower than the 61.6% turnout in 2008 (which had the highest turnout since 1968), it\u2019s still significantly higher than the 56% estimated by  pundits  immediately after the election. \n \n \n Visualization by Hamdan Azhar \n \n \n We also see Trump received more raw votes than Romney in 38 states (shaded in light and dark red above), substantially higher than the 24 states  estimated  by the  Washington Post \u2019s Philip Bump on November 30th. Trump\u2019s lead over Romney was greatest in Florida (4.6 million votes vs. 4.2 million), New York (2.8 million vs. 2.5 million), and Pennsylvania (3 million vs. 2.7 million). Florida and New York are probably least telling, as Clinton also received more votes than Obama in these states. \n In which states, other than Pennsylvania,   did Trump outperform Romney where Clinton also lagged behind Obama? Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana round out the list. In each of these states, Trump received at least 100,000 more votes than Romney, while Hillary Clinton received 433,545 fewer votes than Obama in Ohio, 295,730 fewer votes in Michigan, and 119,761 fewer votes in Indiana. California and Utah are the only two states where Trump fell behind Romney by more than 100,000 votes, by 225,369 votes in Utah, and by 356,148 votes in California. \n \n \n Visualization by Hamdan Azhar \n \n The flip side is that Clinton matched Obama\u2019s performance in 17 states (shaded in light and dark blue above), but she fell behind in six midwest states: Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio. \n \n \n Visualization by Hamdan Azhar \n \n We can summarize the Trump-Romney and Clinton-Obama comparisons in one map where we see, predominantly, dark red indicating Trump held onto Romney\u2019s victories and improved upon them, while Clinton was unable to match Obama\u2019s popular vote totals in many states. \n I also ranked the four candidates\u2019 popular vote totals in each state to see if I could spot any patterns. The most common ordering, showing up in 15 states, was Trump - Romney - Obama - Clinton, which reflects the trend highlighted above of Trump improving upon Romney\u2019s performance and Clinton receiving fewer votes than Obama. The opposite pattern, Clinton - Obama - Romney - Trump, only appears in 5 areas, all of them on the coasts: California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maryland and the District of Columbia. \n Trump\u2019s victory also makes him the highest vote earner of any Republican candidate ever. With his 62.98 million votes, he narrowly defeated George W. Bush\u2019s previous  record , set in 2004, of 62.04 million votes. Meanwhile, President Obama retains the overall record of 69.5 million votes in 2008. \n This election has been rife with paradoxes, chief among them the discrepancy between the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by 2.8 million votes, and the electoral college, where Trump won 304-227. Despite the seeming magnitude of the latter, Cook Political Report has  shown  that just three counties, representing 77,759 voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, determined the outcome of the election.",

Boxes range from $79.99 up to $249.99 and one option - which has already sold out -  includes a snowman kit complete with a top hat, felt scarf, nose and googly eyes.   Waring told  Yahoo:  'Most of the orders are gifts from folks in the North looking to share a little piece of winter with their family and friends in the south.'

Ahead of Pippa's impending nuptials, the Cambridges are spending Christmas with Kate's family at the Middleton home near Bucklebury instead of joining other royals  at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.      Friends said the Middleton family are pulling out all the stops to mark the occasion as it will be Pippa\u2019s last Christmas as a single woman.   She will marry financier James Matthews on May 20 and the couple hope to start their own family soon afterwards.   Prince George,  Pippa's nephew, is tipped to be a page boy and her niece Princess Charlotte, who will have just turned two, a flower girl.   The Duchess of Cambridge's little sister shot to public attention when she wore a bottom-hugging bridesmaid's dress at the royal wedding in 2011.   But she is said to have wanted a smaller, more intimate 'family' wedding when she weds wealthy hedge fund trader James Matthews next year.   The couple are believed to be setting a marquee up in the garden of Michael and Carole Middleton's mansion with upmarket Portaloos brought in for the occasion.   Trendy designer Giles Deacon is rumoured to be making Pippa's dress after he was spotted carrying garment bags into the \u00a317 million house with his and hers bathrooms she and James share in London.   Chelsea florist Lavender Green is arranging the flowers \u2013 likely to include spring blooms like daffodils.   Kate\u2019s sister Pippa has previously written about \u2018magical\u2019 family Christmases and how their father dons fancy dress costumes including, once, that of an inflatable sumo wrestler.    Kate, 34, is very close to her family and has always made clear that they will play a significant role both in her life and those of her children.    This will be the second time Kate and William have joined the Middletons for Christmas Day since they married in 2011 and the first since their children were born.   The last time the couple stayed away from the traditional royal gathering was in December 2012, shortly after Kate was discharged from hospital having been treated for severe morning sickness when she was pregnant with George.   In 2014, William and Kate were believed to have lunched with the Middletons before attending the Christmas Day church service with the royals.   The Middleton mansion has always been a haven for William and Kate, and they spent a number of weeks there within days of George, now three, being born.",

Others include the American Antiquarian Society, the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, the New England Historic Genealogical Society, Rhode Island's Tomaquag Museum, Britain's History of Independence Project and the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum in the Netherlands.   Together, they see an opening as the U.S. prepares in 2020 to mark the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims' arrival in 1620.   'There's a lot of attention being paid right now to how you distinguish between real news and fake news. But this is something historians grapple with all the time,' said Francis Bremer, a professor emeritus of history at Pennsylvania's Millersville University and the coordinator of New England Beginnings.   A key focus, Bremer said, is presenting a much more complete and accurate picture of how the early settlers interacted with Native Americans.   Underscoring the gulf between how natives and white Americans see history, on every Thanksgiving since 1970, members of New England tribes have gathered in downtown Plymouth for a solemn National Day of Mourning observance that recalls the disease, racism and oppression the settlers brought.   'It's an important part of the story that's really taken a back seat for a long time. You just can't bury history,' said Paula Peters, a writer and activist and a member of Massachusetts' Wampanoag tribe.    'People don't know how quickly it became repressive for the Wampanoags. Ship after ship after ship arrived, and they came with laws and deeds.    'You really have to put yourself in the moccasins of the people who were enduring that.'   Peters' pet peeve: 'This myth of the friendly Indians and the grateful Pilgrims who met in Plymouth by the grace of God and everyone lived happily ever after.'   New England Beginnings is turning to technology to remedy such misapprehensions \u2014 and highlight the crucial role the 1600s played in shaping what would become the U.S.   One member, the Boston-based Congregational Library and Archives, has launched a new app \u2014 'Puritan Boston Tests Democracy' \u2014 that sheds light on colonial hypocrisy. (Example: The settlers' first legal guarantee of individual liberty adopted in 1641 also condoned slavery.)   Another member, the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, is preparing an online edition of Plymouth Gov. William Bradford's history, 'Of Plymouth Plantation,' with notes reflecting Native American perspectives.    A third, the Massachusetts Historical Society, soon will release a searchable online version of 'The Winthrop Papers,' a trove of material on early New England.   Scholars hope they can finally turn the page on folklore suggesting that all 102 Mayflower passengers were Pilgrims (only about 40 were) or that Puritan piety was as omnipresent as the Almighty (the word 'fornication' peppers many early accounts).   'There's a very human record in church documents of people getting in fights, abandonment, sexual abuse,' said Peggy Bendroth, director of the Congregational Library and Archives.   'They were very complicated people full of paradoxes and subtleties,' she said. 'It was just as much of a struggle for them as for us.'",

A red tricycle, books, games and toy cars and trucks can already be seen open on the floor.   Despite the family's wealth, the Christmas gifts did not appear to be any more lavish than what a regular American child might get.    The president-elect's eldest child captioned the photo: 'Before and after! #christmas #savage #kids'.    He posted a photo on Christmas Eve of the milk and cookies his children had left for Santa before they went it bed.    'And the bait is set. Kids in bed and actually sleeping going to be a busy morning,' he wrote.    His family, including wife Vanessa,  are spending the Christmas holidays with Donald and wife Melania at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Springs, Florida.     The soon-to-be first couple were spotted arriving at a nearby church on Saturday night for midnight mass.    Most members of the church could be seen standing up and cheering when the Trumps arrived and took their seats.   Trump's other son Eric tweeted a photo of his wife Lara and their dogs wishing followers a merry Christmas from North Carolina.",

The tree's steel-and-wire frame is covered with a plastic net decorated with more than 1 million natural pine cones painted red, gold, green and silver, 600,000 LED bulbs and topped by a 6-meter (20-foot)-tall  shining star.   The tree costs $80,000 and was criticized by the Catholic Church as a 'waste of money.' The church suggested that the funds better be spent on helping the poor.   Hundreds of port workers and volunteers struggled for four months to put up the tree in time for the holidays.    Work was suspended for six days in early December after Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith \u2014 representing the island nation's 1.5 million Catholics \u2014 lambasted the project.    Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to the criticism by saying the tree was not being built with public money, but with donations from individuals and private firms.   The Guinness World Records is yet to confirm if this is the tallest artificial Christmas tree.    Currently, the record is held by a Chinese firm that put up a 55-meter (180-foot) tree-like tower of lights and synthetic foliage, ornaments and lamps in the city of Guangzhou last year.   Sri Lankan organizers said they wanted the tree to help promote ethnic and religious harmony in the Buddhist-majority island nation, where a long civil war ended in 2009 but reconciliation remains a challenge.   'This is just to show the world that we can live as one country, one nation,' said Arjuna Ranatunga, a former cricket player and the minister of ports and shipping.    He said Sri Lanka still is still grappling with issues regarding religion, caste and race.   Minority Christian and Muslim communities complain of state-sponsored discrimination, and there are allegations of widespread abuses against minority ethnic Tamils both during and after the war.",

Firefighters battled the flames this morning but it reignited again in the afternoon.    The services were initially called to the refinery at 11.30am but when the fire had not completely died down, but had reignited, it emerged the amount of gas left may have been miscalculated.    Investigations are currently underway as to whether the fire was caused by static electricity,  reports Ynetnews .    A spokesman from the national firefighters' commission, Yoram Levi, told Ynet: 'The incident is centered on one tank that is burning and that will burn until the fire is put out. The aim is to prevent damage to other tanks.   'Fire fighting aircraft are not relevant for this incident. We are using foam and water cannons. In addition, we are cooling down the gas tanks situated nearby.    'This is a very serious incident it can potentially cause extremely serious danger.'   Jpost added that the Haifa District Municipal Association for Environmental Protection encouraged all residents of Kiryat Haim and Kiryat Motzkin to close their windows and doors and stay inside, due to the fine particle pollution caused by the gasoline combustion.",

Typhoon Nock-Ten made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes at 6.30pm local time and is tearing westwards with gusts of 146 miles an hour and heavy rain.   State weather service officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the storm, but darkness has now fallen and the true damage may not be known until dawn.   Provincial officials said at least 102,000 people from the coasts, Catanduanes and the nearby Bicol peninsula, an impoverished region which is home to more than five million, have been moved out of harm's way.   'Most of Bicol is without electricity,' said Joaquin Berces, a member of the region's civil defence office, as residents hunkered down in the dark.   Speaking from Legazpi City, 350 miles south east of the capital Manila, he said: 'We stayed indoors for our own safety and we probably won't know the extent of the damage until tomorrow.   He said communication and power lines have been cut in Catanduanes.   Experts had earlier warned of large coastal waves of up to eight feet high, floods and landslides.   The typhoon was forecast to sweep west toward the country's most densely populated areas, passing just south of the capital Manila on Monday afternoon.   Weather forecaster Lorie de la Cruz said: 'It would pass over land overnight and we hope that would dissipate the typhoon's strength somewhat.'    Nock-Ten, named after a bird found in Laos, struck in the middle of the Christmas holidays in the mainly Catholic nation, and one provincial governor offered roast pig at evacuation centres to entice people to abandon celebrations at home.   Criselda Buenvenuto, 68, lives alone in the kitchen of her house after the rest of it was destroyed during a typhoon that killed more than 1,000 people 10 years ago.    The widow, sheltering in a school in Santo Domingo, said: 'Floods terrify me. Each time I hear about a coming typhoon I want to throw up.'   In the village of Alcala on the slopes of the active Mayon volcano, about 100 babies, toddlers, parents and elderly people were the first to be evacuated as rain and strong winds shook trees.   Local official Alberto Lindo said: 'There are large ash deposits on the slopes. Heavy rain can dislodge them and bury our homes in mud.'   The government forced more than 12,000 residents to move away from the Catanduanes coast, provincial vice governor Shirley Abundo said on ABS-CBN television.      All ferry services and commercial flights in the area were suspended.   Some 20 typhoons or lesser storms strike the Philippines each year, routinely killing hundreds of people, and Bicol is often the first region to be hit.   It prides itself on having sharpened its disaster response to minimise casualties.   Rescue workers in Manila and surrounding provinces have been put on standby, evacuation centres opened and food and other rations stocked.   The coastguard today ordered the beaches south of Manila to be cleared of holidaymakers, while residents of the capital's seaside slums were warned to leave their homes.   Mammoth tsunami-like waves devastated the city of Tacloban and nearby areas when super typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines in November 2013, leaving 7,350 people dead or missing.",

   "7. content": "Jeremy Clarkson has declared war on Argentina again with a very unseasonally aggressive tweet, two years after his famous Falklands number plate row.   The former Top Gear presenter, whose new show The Grand Tour launched recently, tweeted in the early hours today: 'Happy Christmas to everyone. Except the Tierra Del Fuego people of Argentina. You lot can sod off.'    In October 2014 Clarkson and his Top Gear team were forced to flee the town of Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego in the far south of Argentina under police escort as furious thugs tried to 'kill' them.   Rock-throwing protesters had vowed to 'barbecue' the controversial motoring show host after he drove a Porsche with the plate H982 FKL, seen as a reference to the 1982 conflict, around Argentina.   Veterans of the Falklands - or Malvinas - conflict laid siege to the hotel where Clarkson and fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May were staying after news of the number plate appeared online.        Clarkson, who was filming a Top Gear special for the BBC - who later fired him, said at the time: 'I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan, but this was the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.'   His abusive Twitter post has attracted further ire from Argentinians, with the Mirror reporting that Argentinian voice artist Albert Canil slammed Clarkson as  'buffoon'.   Mr Canil said: 'Jeremy Clarkson has needlessly insulted Argentines with his vulgar Twitter that made the headlines today.   'What a disservice this buffoon has rendered to the UK.'    His latest broadside has been met with fury by Argentine newspapers but one of them managed to mix him up with May, whose photograph was used on the story. It was not clear if that was a deliberate insult or just a mistake caused by him being not famous in Argentina, but the picture was later changed.   Albert Canil, a voice artist from Argentina, told Mail Online: 'Jeremy Clarkson has needlessly insulted Argentines with his vulgar Twitter that made the headlines today.'   He said: 'The electronic media have already reproduced the offensive message and, as the day progresses, this un-Christmas tirade continues to spread sowing ill will not only against Clarkson but against Britain. What a disservice this buffoon has rendered to the UK.'   Clarkson has always denied the number plate row was a deliberate provocation of locals' feelings about the conflict, which resulted in the death of 649 Argentines, around half of them on the sunk battleship General Belgrano.   He said at the time when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black.   He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina.   Clarkson went on to say no-one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile.",

Urban planners see the preservation of historic buildings and other structures as essential in creating the kinds of communities people want to live in, said Stephanie Meeks, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Trust for Historic Preservation. \n Probably the best-known project is New York City's High Line, an abandoned elevated railroad section converted into a park in 2009. It's shown cities that such pieces of infrastructure can be diamonds in the rough, said Robert Steuteville, with the Congress for the New Urbanism, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that promotes sustainable communities. \n \n \n \n \n Expand / Contract \n \n \n \n Pedestrians walks along High Line park in New York City\n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                         (Reuters) \n \n \n \n \"That's why other cities are saying, 'Aha. We have this thing. What can we do with it?' Very often you can do something with it that actually generates value,\" he said. \n In Houston, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership saw the preservation of the Cistern, first built in 1926 and decommissioned in 2007, as a way to save a piece of history and educate visitors about Houston's relationship with its bayous, which have provided both drinking water and drainage. The group also saw the Cistern as a good fit for its plans to display art throughout the renovated Buffalo Bayou Park, 160 acres that the reservoir sits next to. \n The first exhibition is an abstract-video installation called \"Rain\" by Venezuelan artist Magdalena Fern\u00e1ndez. The nearly two-minute video, accompanied by a soundtrack of snapping fingers and stomping heels that mimics falling rain, projects a series of white geometric shapes onto the darkened concrete columns and the shallow pool of water on the Cistern floor to evoke the atmosphere of a stormy night. It can be seen until June through scheduled tours. \n In San Francisco, officials and community leaders are working to turn a reservoir shuttered in 1940 into a park. In October, officials in Philadelphia broke ground on a project to transform an abandoned rail line into a public park similar to the High Line. In Buffalo, a collection of concrete grain elevators that are remnants of the city's heyday as a shipping hub are being reused as locations for restaurants, outdoor concerts and as the projection screen for a nightly light show. In Washington, D.C, a cultural organization is transforming an abandoned trolley station underneath the Dupont Circle neighborhood into a place for exhibitions and artistic expression. \n Atlanta is in the midst of a project to transform 22 miles of a mostly abandoned railroad corridor that encircles the city into a network of trails, parks, affordable homes and rail transit that will connect 45 neighborhoods. The project is set to be completed in 2030. \n \"This really is a legacy project that goes out 20 years, 30 years, 50 years,\" said Kevin Burke, senior landscape architect for the project, which is managed by the economic development agency Atlanta BeltLine Inc. \"We really have to have that long view as to what we are doing and the impact that we will have not only on the current generations of Atlanta residents and visitors but those yet to come for decades.\"",

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office has been investigating the charity following media reports that foundation spending went to benefit Trump's campaign.    The Democratic Party meanwhile said shutting down the Trump Foundation is not enough and is calling for the billionaire businessman to put his assets in a blind trust - echoing the criticism Trump has received over upcoming conflicts of interest.    'I will be devoting so much time and energy to the presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world. I don't want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,' Trump said in a statement.   The president-elect said he would pursue philanthropic efforts in other ways, but he didn't elaborate on how he'd do so.   But the foundation 'cannot legally dissolve' until the investigation is complete, attorney general press secretary Amy Spitalnick said Saturday.   The charitable foundation was ordered to immediately stop fundraising in New York just weeks before the general election, after Schneiderman's office said it wasn't registered to do so.   The New York attorney general's office said in October the Trump Foundation had a registration for an organization with assets in New York, but the law requires a different registration for those that solicit more than $25,000 a year from the public. The charity complied with the order and stopped its fundraising activities.    A 2015 tax return posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar shows the Donald J Trump Foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of IRS regulations \u2014 not only during 2015, but in prior years.   Those regulations prohibit self-dealing by the charity. That's broadly defined as using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.   The tax filing doesn't provide details on the violations. Whether Trump benefited from the foundation's spending has been the subject of an investigation by Schneiderman.   In September, Schneiderman disclosed that his office has been investigating Trump's charity to determine whether it has abided by state laws governing nonprofits.   Documents obtained by The Associated Press in September showed Schneiderman's scrutiny of The Donald J Trump Foundation dated back to at least June, when his office formally questioned the donation made by the charity to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.   Bondi personally solicited the money during a 2013 phone call that came after her office received complaints from former students claiming they were scammed by Trump University, Trump's get-rich-quick real estate seminars.   The Trump Foundation check arrived just days after Bondi's office told a newspaper it was reviewing a lawsuit against Trump University filed by Schneiderman. Bondi's office never sued Trump, though she denies his donation played any role in that decision.   Trump later paid a $2,500 fine over the check from his foundation because it violated federal law barring charities from making political contributions.     Trump was highly critical of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's family charity, the Clinton Foundation, saying without evidence that she ran 'a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department' while she was secretary of state. At the final presidential debate, he challenged Clinton to 'give back the money' that came from donors in countries that fail to respect various human rights.   More than half the people outside the government who met with Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money \u2014 either personally or through companies or groups \u2014 to the Clinton Foundation. The proportion indicated possible ethics challenges had she been elected president.   Trump's announcement to dissolve his own foundation came a day after the president-elect took to Twitter to declare it a 'ridiculous shame' that his son Eric will have to stop soliciting funds for his charitable foundation, the Eric Trump Foundation, because of a conflict of interest.   'My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with my presidency,' Trump tweeted. 'He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!'     The Democratic National Committee criticized the president-elect for what it called 'a wilted fig leaf to cover up his remaining conflicts of interest and his pitiful record of charitable giving'.   The statement from party spokesman Eric Walker also took a jab at the president-elect over his controversial business holdings: 'Shuttering a charity is no substitute for divesting from his for-profit business and putting the assets in a blind trust \u2014 the only way to guarantee separation between the Trump administration and the Trump business.'   As the public criticism of Trump's international business operation has intensified, the president-elect, the family is working toward clearing as many potential conflicts as possible before the January 20 inauguration.   'I certainly can't deny there is a greater desire to sort of clear the decks as much as possible to avoid distractions,' said Alan Garten, the general counsel at the Trump Organization, told the  New York Times .   Trump's children have played a prominent role in their father's campaign as well as his transition, which has also raised questions among critics about perceived conflicts of interest.   After his election victory, Ivanka Trump sat in on a meeting between her father and the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, at Trump Tower in New York.   Trump was criticized for this because his daughter, who owns and markets her own line of clothing and apparel, has pending business deals and interests with the Japanese government.   Both the Trump Organization and the Ivanka Trump brand are exploring options that would block contact between companies and the federal government, including hiring an outside monitor to oversee the businesses.   The Trump Organization has terminated pending deals for hotels and apartment buildings in Brazil, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Argentina and India.   Labor disputes at Trump's hotels in Las Vegas were settled on Wednesday.   More than 500 food and beverage and housekeeping employees at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement effective January 1 that guarantees annual raises and pension and healthcare benefits, Trump Hotels and Unite Here Culinary Workers Union Local 226 said in a joint statement.   Under the agreement, the union will withdraw a series of cases filed with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board against the hotel, union spokeswoman Bethany Khan said.   Those cases had been expected to be an early test of how Trump, who as president will have influence over the NLRB, would handle concerns over conflicts of interest raised by his business holdings.   President-elect Trump's transition team is also considering the use of discretionary trusts to avoid conflicts of interest for Trump family members or administration officials.   Such an arrangement would provide individuals with an alternative to selling off assets or placing wealth in blind trusts, which president-elects traditionally do.   Trump aides have discussed the idea of discretionary trusts with the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), but it was unclear whether the set-up would be for Trump, his family or any of the wealthy individuals nominated to his Cabinet, according to Politico, which cited two unidentified sources briefed on the talks.   Politico reported on the potential use of a discretionary trust.   Among Trump's many holdings are hotels and golf resorts from Panama to Scotland, besides a winery and modeling agency   Federal law does not prohibit the president's involvement in private business while in office but most presidents in recent decades have placed their personal assets in blind trusts so they do not know how their decisions influence their personal fortunes.",

Cooper, who won his campaign with just 10,000 votes over GOP Governor Pat McCrory, vows to bend back the rightward course of the state - even though it appears increasingly difficult to do so.   With a bitter partisan distrust within the legislature, Cooper has already slipped along the rocky path he must walk in the face a fierce opposition. And Republicans will maintain veto-proof majorities in 2017.   'My future negotiations with them are certainly going to have to be instructed by this,' a somber yet angry Cooper told reporters last week after the deal to repeal the law known nationally as the 'bathroom bill' collapsed.   Two December special sessions, one of which saw raucous protests against Republicans and dozens of arrests, have created further strain in the divided state that chose Republicans Donald Trump for president and Richard Burr for U.S. Senate.   'There's a complete lack of trust between the legislative leadership and Cooper at this point in time,' longtime state Democratic consultant Brad Crone said. 'That does not bode well for an incoming governor.'   Missing out on ending House Bill 2 \u2014 which also directed transgender people to use bathrooms in public buildings corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate \u2014 prompted finger-pointing between Cooper and legislative leaders.    It would have been a major accomplishment to repeal a bill that has been blamed for job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events, and staining North Carolina's reputation.   'I think Roy Cooper did everything he could to sabotage a reasonable compromise,' said Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham.   Cooper shot back: 'My mom and dad used to tell me that when you sat down and looked somebody in the eye and told them something you should keep your promise, and clearly they have not done so.'   Even before the General Assembly sessions, Cooper already was at a disadvantage.   Cooper is a 30-year veteran of state politics \u2014 14 years in the legislature before 16 as attorney general \u2014 and claimed victory on election night.    But it was another 27 days before McCrory conceded while dozens of ballot protests and a partial recount worked out the results.   Set to take office on January 1, Cooper hasn't yet announced a single Cabinet appointment \u2014 something McCrory had done by this time after his 2012 election.   He faces new hurdles, since the General Assembly approved a law this month requiring his Cabinet choices be confirmed by legislators.    The state Constitution gives the Senate the ability to 'advise and consent' to the governor's appointees by a majority vote, but that provision hadn't been used in at least several decades.   GOP legislators argued they are only rebalancing the powers between the legislative and executive branches, but Democrats and their allies call it a brazen, unlawful power grab.   Another law reduces the number of political appointees Cooper can hire.    Republicans had expanded the number of such policymaking jobs for McCrory from 400 to 1,500. That number goes back down to 425 for Cooper.   Cooper previously threatened lawsuits to challenge the efforts to scale back his power. 'They will see me in court,' he told The Charlotte Observer last week.   Even as lawmakers held special sessions, the board of North Carolina's private nonprofit tasked with luring companies to the state \u2014 now filled with appointees from McCrory and the legislature \u2014 passed a bylaw change that will make it hard for Cooper to put his board choices on quickly.   The bad blood with lawmakers could portend Cooper's difficulties to follow through on other campaign platform planks, such as accelerating public education funding and shifting tax burdens away from the middle class.    He's also vowed to preserve voting and abortion rights after Republicans passed laws in 2013 scaling back early in-person voting and extending the abortion waiting period to three days.   But both Cooper and GOP lawmakers have said they could locate areas of agreement.   'I am optimistic that we can strike a good balance with the governor-elect in trying to build a consensus agenda and move our state forward,' said Rep. David Lewis, R-Harnett, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee.    'Relationships have changed between the legislative and the executive branch, but that doesn't mean .... we can't work together.'",

The passengers from the hijacked Libyan flight that was diverted to Malta left the Mediterranean island and returned home on Saturday.   Officials claimed the men flew to Malta to scure political asylum in Europe and create a new political party in honor of the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi.   After hours of negotiations, the standoff ended peacefully with the hijackers freeing all 117 people on board and walking off the plane to surrender.   The passengers were subsequently interviewed by officials.",

Several were photographed panic-buying bottled water in the limited number of open shops.    The lack of water supply meant many were also unable to flush their toilets and have showers and baths.     A spokeswoman for Thames water apologised for the problems caused to residents' festive celebrations.   She said: 'We apologise that customers in the TW and W postcodes are without water.   'This is because of an issue with our Hampton pumps.   'We have experienced technicians on site who are working to restore supply as quickly as possible.   'Our pumps have failed at one of our sites.

The water supplier tweeted an update at 11.52am, which said: 'Our engineers have managed to restart pumps on site - this means that you will slowly start to regain pressure.'   Richmond Council tweeted: 'The water pumps have been fixed and will be restoring water shortly.'   Some residents said their water returned shortly after the pumps were fixed, however, some were still without water several hours later.",

The 56 bells, which are the finest in the country in terms of the sound, rung on Thursday, December 22 and again on Christmas Eve for the first time since October.   But the peal, which is the fourth heaviest in the country and said to be one of the best in the world, was non-existent on the big day today.   It is thought to be the first time they have not rung on December 25 since 1361.      In October, all 30 volunteer bell ringers were told they were no longer needed by church managers, axed from their roles and told to reapply.   It was then revealed that the controversy was caused by the Minster's refusal to reinstate a suspended member who had an interim sexual risk order removed after police investigation did not lead to prosecution.    This member has not been named by the Chapter but is understood to be David Potter, a leading light of the campanology world, who was given an MBE for his services to bell-ringing and has never been convicted of any offences.   Mr Potter was the subject of a police investigation in 1999 which was reviewed again in 2014 but he was never charged.   The Chapter of York Minster ordered a detailed risk assessment of Mr Potter's activities and decided he 'presented an ongoing risk and that the potential severity of the risk meant they could not be reinstated'.   It said the bell ringers refused to accept this decision and so had to be disbanded.    The departure of the volunteers sparked a huge online petition to get the group reinstated so the bells would ring on Remembrance Sunday, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.   The petition was signed by almost 18,000 people who condemned the decision.    In October, York Minster said a new team of volunteers would be recruited headed by a paid bell-ringer known as the 'Head of Tower'.   But this process was expected to take several months and it is believed the York Minster planned for the bells not to ring again until April.   The tradition of the minster's ancient bells ringing out on Christmas day was started in 1361.       In October, Mr Potter's solicitor, Colin Byrne, said: 'Mr Potter has no cautions or convictions or any civil findings ever made against him.   'Issues surrounding the bell ringers and the Minster is a private and confidential matter between those two parties but the process that he has been subject to has shown a disregard for due process and equally the treatment of his fellow bell-ringers.'      Then the York's Dean and Chapter invited Leeds Minsters to ring the Christmas service bells, but the team rejected the invitation in an act of solidarity.   York Minster's Christmas Day service included an 11.45am Christmas Day Choral Matins, where The Dean of York was due to deliver the message.      The Dean of York Minster Vivienne Faull and the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, who supported the decision, were both in attendance at the service.    York Minster has been contacted for comment.",

Mrs Obama, who is in Hawaii on vacation with her family, patiently explained that Santa couldn't get to the phone 'because he's delivering all the gifts'.   But Austin also had another concern in mind: Would Santa know where to go?   'I'm going to move to another house,' said Austin, joined by three other kids in North Carolina.   No matter, Mrs Obama replied.   'He's going to be able to find you no matter where you go,' she said, according to a transcript released by the White House. 'That's the special thing about Santa.'   The first lady spent roughly a half-hour taking calls before joining her husband, daughters Sasha and Malia and family friends for lunch in Honolulu.   But before the family fun, there was a geography lesson as the first lady updated children about Santa's most recent locales on his gift-giving voyage: Sardinia, Malta and Hungary, to name a few.   If there was a lesson for Mrs Obama, it was a crash course in the latest hot-item gifts.     A girl named Kirsten told Mrs Obama she wanted a drone from Santa. Joshua wanted a Hot Wheels garage, while Aiden wanted a hoverboard.   But it was Adilyn whose gift seemed to catch the first lady off guard.   'I'm getting a hedgehog tomorrow,' Adilyn said.   It is the last time Mrs Obama will carry out her annual Christmas ritual as first lady.    It'll be up to the next first lady, Melania Trump, to decide next year whether to continue the tradition.       Navy Lt Cmdr Paul Noel said 1,500 volunteers answered nearly 141,000 phone calls and more than 2,800 emails last year as part of the program.   The volunteers sit elbow-to-elbow in conference rooms at the base in Colorado, answering phones and checking computer-generated maps projected onto big screens.    Last year, NORAD's website had 22 million unique visitors, Noel said.                 The tradition started in 1955 when a Colorado Springs newspaper ad invited children to call Santa Claus but accidentally listed the number for the hotline at the Continental Air Defense Command, NORAD's predecessor.   Air Force Col Harry Shoup took a call from a child and thought he was being pranked.    When he figured out he was talking to a little boy, he pretended he was Santa.   More children called, and Shoup instructed airmen to play along.   It's now a tradition, beloved by kids and the military.   Volunteers range from generals and admirals to enlisted men and women, who sometimes report for telephone duty in military uniform and a Santa hat.     NORAD is a joint US-Canada operation that defends the sky over both nations and monitors sea approaches.    It's best known for its Cold War-era control room deep inside Cheyenne Mountain \u2014 now used only as a backup \u2014 and for NORAD Tracks Santa.",

How exactly Republicans intend to unravel parts or all of that law next year remains unclear. \n The Trump adviser also addressed the recent terror attacks in Berlin and beyond, acknowledging that the incoming administration still needs to form a strategy for confronting the Islamic State. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think they have a strategy,\u201d he said, while touting Trump\u2019s national security team and voicing confidence \u201cthey\u2019re going to be able to produce a very aggressive strategy.\u201d",

The bloodied photo was included in an affidavit by the FBI following Snow's arrest.   Snow and his girlfriend were only allowed on the flight after they agreed to not drink any alcohol as they were already drunk when they tried to board,  East Bay Times  reports.   About halfway through the flight, Snow and Zeebregts got into a fight that was so raucous that they were separated, said a police affidavit.    Zeebregts was brought to the back of the plane, but became so disruptive that attendants had to restrain her to prevent injuries to other passengers.   At this point, the attendants smelled smoke and identified Snow as the one puffing away.    They also noticed he was drinking and figured he must have sneaked his own alcohol onto the flight.   When Snow was told to put out the cigarette he allegedly became aggressive, and two male flight attendants had to restrain him.    He allegedly struggled and fought with the unidentified attendants, including biting one man on the ear.    He was finally subdued and a female flight attendant sat next to him for the duration of the flight to try to keep him calm.   When the flight landed, the flight attendant was taken to the hospital and Snow was arrested.   He is charged with interference with flight crew members and attendants, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   He was released on $25,000 bond and is scheduled for an arraignment on January 12. Zeebregts was not charged in the incident.",

'Then it's dig-out time.'   Gust's advice to holiday travelers: 'Stay put.'   A blizzard warning was in effect for most of North Dakota, western South Dakota and a small section of eastern Montana through Monday, with expected snow totals of 8 to 15 inches and winds up to 55 mph.   The Dakota Access pipeline protest encampment in southern North Dakota will be affected.    Though many left during a blizzard earlier this month, Morton County Sheriff's Department spokesman Rob Keller said there could be at least 500 people still at the camp.    The South Dakota Department of Transportation announced the closing Sunday night of Interstate 90 from the Wyoming border to Chamberlain \u2014 a stretch of about 260 miles.    'The freezing rain from earlier today and dropping temps have created icy and slushy roadways; falling snow and increasing winds are creating zero visibility conditions in the west,' the department said in a statement.   The North Dakota Transportation Department closed a 240-mile stretch of Interstate 94 Sunday night, from the Montana border to Jamestown.    A 100-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 83 between Bismarck and Minot also was closed due to drifting snow and near-zero visibility.   Up to a half inch of ice could accumulate in central Minnesota, and the weather service has said anyone who 'must travel' should have an extra flashlight, food and water.   Meteorologist Bill Abeling of the Bismarck NWS office told the Bismarck Tribune that ice accumulation was reportedly causing power outages near Jamestown and Verona.   In southeast Nebraska, high winds were cited as the likely cause of about 800 Omaha Public Power District customers losing power Sunday, the Omaha World-Reported.   The NWS office in Aberdeen, South Dakota, issued a flash flood warning for Brown County Sunday night due to the combination of rain and melting snow. As of shortly after 6pm, flooding was reported at several major intersections in Aberdeen.   Rain and possible storms were due to move through parts of Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska on Sunday.   Winter Storm Europa is slated to reach the east coast on Monday, as the the National Weather Service warns people who plan to hit the road after Christmas to take extra precautions.   An icy mix is expected across Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of Maine and western Massachusetts at the start of the week.",

   "7. content": "GAO, Mali \u2013   As the sun starts to fall, the call to prayer at the mosque echoes throughout Gao, a predominantly Muslim town in northern Mali. At that same moment, a small church bell nearby also rings. \n It's a reminder that even in a town where just four years ago strict Islamic law was in force, some Christians have returned to rebuild their congregation, which fled the jihadist occupation. \n This is the first Christmas they've been able to hold a service at the Catholic church, which was torched in 2012 by the al-Qaida-linked militants who took over the major towns in northern Mali that year. \n Yet even as they celebrate, the fear of persecution is still widespread. Police stood by to protect the church as worshippers met Saturday and they returned again Sunday for the morning service. In a sign of the dangers that lurk, a Swiss aid worker was abducted from her home by armed men on Christmas Eve. \n The turnout this year at the Saturday night service was only several dozen people. In total, there are now about 125 to 150 Christians who have come back \u2014 though that is still only half of what the population once was, says Philippe Omore, president of the Christian community in Gao. \n \"The congregants have been fearful \u2014 they don't want to come to the church yet so we must raise awareness,\" he said. \n Inside the church on Christmas Eve, a small choir of 10 people sang hymns in front of a tree lit up with colorful lights that was set next to a small nativity scene. After the two-hour service, church members met in a dining area on site to share sandwiches and salad. \n Many of the extremists who ruled Gao in 2012 came from outside the country \u2014 Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Mauritania \u2014 and they enforced their strict interpretation of Islam upon the local community, where tolerance had long reigned between Muslims and Christians. \n While the West African country is overwhelmingly Muslim, some Malians converted to Christianity during colonialism when the country was ruled by predominantly Catholic France. \n French forces ultimately liberated the town in 2013 but Christians who had fled to central and southern Mali waited about a year to make sure the peace would hold before they returned. Next they had to rebuild the church that had been destroyed by jihadists. \n \"Christmas brings us joy in spite of the security threats,\" said the Rev. Afeku Anthero, a priest from Uganda. \"On this night, God sent us his son as the prince of peace. Peace should reign in our hearts, in the Christian community and in our country. This is especially important for Mali where we need peace and where it has been difficult to reconcile and unite us.\" \n Still, Omore says life remains tenuous for the Christians who have returned, and peace is a dream at this point. \n \"Before the crisis, we could go walk on the sand dunes outside of Gao but today because of the security situation that is no longer possible. We miss it, and we want to live as we did in the past \u2014 free and without fear for our safety.\"",

Scroll down for video    Chile's national emergency office ordered the evacuation of coastal areas of Los Lagos region.    Chile's President Michelle Bachelet wrote on Twitter: 'Much strength and encouragement to the compatriots affected by the tremor in Chile and other areas in the south. Emergency procedures are already in place.'    According to media reports, the quake was felt as far as the southwest Argentine city of Bariloche.    Taxi driver Luis Ramirez said cars equipped with loudspeakers were roaming the streets urging people to evacuate beach areas.    He said he was washing his car in his hometown of Ancud when the quake struck.   He said: 'I'm 48 years old and I've never felt anything so strong,' he said.   Chile is one of the most seismically active locations on the globe.    The latest quake comes after an 8.3-magnitude quake hit the country in September last year, which left 13 dead and caused a million people to leave their homes.   That followed an 8.8-magnitude quake in 2010, which devastated large swathes of Chile and killed 524 people.   In the hours after that quake, President Bachelet and her government misjudged the extent of damage and declined offers of international aid. This delayed the flow of assistance to disaster areas, leaving many survivors feeling they had been abandoned by the government.     Chile is geologically volatile as it sits on the Pacific Ocean's 'Ring of Fire,' a seismically turbulent region where many of Earth's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.",

Thousands of spectators cheered and whistled as 11 gay and one transgender prisoner danced and sang at the 'Miss Universe' pageant at the Quezon City Jail courtyard, garbed in wigs, make-up, gowns and elaborate Mardi Gras attire.   The decaying Manila jail, housing about 3,800 inmates, is the Philippines' most notoriously overcrowded prison. Men take turns sleeping in the cells, an open-air basketball court and even on stairways of the facility, built to hold 800 prisoners.   But inmates were treated to a show of glamour and glitz for one day, with densely-packed crowds appearing in high spirits as they watched criminals strut their stuff.   'It's lonely in here but I'm happy that I won,' the winner called Gwen, whose real name cannot be used due to prison policy, said.   Gwen, arrested nearly two years ago and on trial for drug dealing, said his victory had brought 'acclaim for my brigade', referring to his gang.   All 12 of the gangs in the prison were allowed to enter one contestant to the gay beauty pageant, organised by a jail contractor.   'This is part of inmate welfare development. Once they join activities like this they get less jail time through the good conduct time allowance law,' said the service provider, Ferdinand Abejon.   The Quezon City Jail holds defendants of criminal cases but who have not yet been convicted. Due to overburdened courts many of the inmates have been locked up there for years.   The Philippine penal system is the third most congested in the world, according to the University of London's Institute for Criminal Policy Research.   Jails nationwide have nearly five times more inmates than they were built for, government data shows.   The situation is set to get much worse with police having arrested more than 40,000 suspects since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte launched a war on drugs that has also left more than 5,300 people dead since July.   The real Miss Universe pageant is a popular contest in the Philippines, with Filipina beauty queen Pia Wurtzbach winning the crown last year.   Manila is hosting the annual contest next month.",

Even if Joel ends up in a more regional company, it will be incredible.\" \n \n \n \n \n Expand / Contract \n \n \n \n Young ballerinas receive instruction from Kenyan ballet dancer Joel Kioko, 16. \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                         (AP) \n \n \n \n Kioko grew up in Nairobi's Kuwinda slum and took his first dance class five years ago in a public school classroom, with bare walls, no barre and no mirror, the desks and chairs pushed outside. \n Now he's teaching holiday classes to aspiring dancers in Kibera, the Kenyan capital's biggest slum. \n \"I don't know what I could have done without ballet, without dancing,\" Kioko said. \"I don't even know if I could have been existing, it's weird to say, but dance, it's everything to me.\" \n \n \n \n \n Expand / Contract \n \n \n \n Kenyan ballet dancer Joel Kioko, 16, strikes a pose as a joke as he walks through the courtyard of a school where he was teaching young dancers in Nairobi, Kenya. \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                         (AP) \n \n \n \n His encounter with ballet happened by chance when he was 11. He was discovered by a fellow dance student who at age 14 was teaching a class at his school and told her teacher, Rust, about him. \n \"From the beginning, when he joined the ballet, there was nothing else he could talk about,\" said Kioko's mother, Angela Kamene, who raised him and his sister in a one-bedroom shack shared with an aunt and a grandmother. \"It was just ballet, ballet, ballet. So I saw that he was happy, and so I was happy too.\" \n Now others are pursuing dance as a way out of poverty. At the beginning of the school year, children in Kibera try out for the ballet classes, which are funded by charities Anno's Africa and One Fine Day. \n Michael Wamaya, a finalist for the 2017 Global Teacher Prize, teaches dance to around 100 kids a week in Nairobi's Kibera and Mathare slums. \n \"At the end of the day, we're not just training them to have dance for fun, we're doing it in a serious level,\" Wamaya said. \"We are doing it to make them have a career at the end.\" \n \n \n \n \n Expand / Contract \n \n \n \n Young ballerinas practice under the instruction of Kenyan ballet dancer Joel Kioko, 16. \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                         (AP) \n \n \n \n But not everyone is applauding. \n \"I can see it gives young people opportunities,\" said Christy Adair, professor of dance studies at Britain's York St. John University and a prominent voice on ethnicity in dance. But she added: \"I think there's a kind of arrogance in the ballet organizations, where they think theirs is the way for training for dance. ... Contemporary technique is more open to other people's movement patterns and practices and experiences and heritages, which ballet isn't.\" \n Wamaya acknowledged the criticism. \"People say sometimes, why are you not teaching them, for instance, African dance or hip hop?\" he said. \"Yes, it's a Western thing coming in, but it's dance, and dance is diverse, you know? To me, it's not about ballet as a dance style, but it's about the discipline that ballet has in itself as a dance technique.\" \n As the only son in a family growing up without a father, Kioko laughed at the notion that some people might consider a man in tights, dancing classical ballet, to be unmanly. He was teased by some in his neighborhood about the dancing, he said, but he never had to fight. \n \"Where I came from there is poverty, there is stealing, there is drugs,\" Kioko said. \"You have to be a man to live in where we live. ... It's like a lion in the jungle, you have to show that you are the male there, you are the one who roars and everyone follows.\"",

An anonymous ex-serviceman spotted the camouflaged men collecting coins with a bucket in Nottingham city centre.   But he says they were not serving soldiers, making it an offence to wear the colours.   He then bamboozled them with questions about their military history, IDs and charity permits.   Mr Eastway recorded the angry exchange on his phone as the men become aggressive when he told them: 'You are not ex-forces,' in front of stunned passersby.   The men were asking for \u00a33 to \u00a35 for blue wristbands for 'Invcited', which Mr Easyway says is a play on words of Prince Harry's Invictus charity.   They admitted that they keep \u00a31 from every sale for themselves.    But when asked for a charity number, ID badges and permits from the local council, they were stumped and became aggressive.   The Charities Commission has no record of Invicted Foundation and a Facebook page for the group has just 170 members.   Footage shows Mr Eastway ask them: 'Where's your ID?' and one of the men replies: 'I haven't got one,' before becoming aggressive.   Another says: 'We are ex-forces,' and Mr Eastway says: 'You're not ex-forces though, are you. Lets talk about your bands.'   One of the men says: 'It's called Invicted. We came out of the army and set up.'   Asked if he's posing as a charity, the man says: 'We are a limited company. So the money comes to us and this is what we do with it.'   The men then mumble before walking away from Mr Eastway at the end of the 5-minute clip.   The counter terrorism expert from Bootle, Merseyside, said: 'These are out and out rogue traders. They have no connection to any charities.   'They're riding off the back of people like me who have fought in Afghanistan, people who have been injured, people who have lost their limbs.   'None of these men are serving soldiers, so it is an offence for them to wear army uniform in public, let alone be posing as a charity.   'They were selling wristbands and magazines to people who believed that they were helping soldiers.   'But these guys were clearly not serving soldiers and had none of the proper documents when I confronted them.   'It's morally wrong, ethically wrong, and legally wrong and it needs to be stopped.'   Shane Hartley, seen in the video wearing black gloves and with light brown hair combed to one side, said he had been a serving soldier but left six weeks ago.   Speaking after the confrontation, he said: 'I'm not in the army anymore.   'We're not a charity. We're just trying to help people at Christmas but people want to know about how much money we're earning like we're some kind of millionaires.   'We're putting homeless people in a hotel over Christmas.'   In November Manchester Police issued a warning about the group, which claimed to be collecting cash for armed forces and homeless charities by selling wristbands and magazines.   City centre inspector Phil Surgeon said they were investigating the group and told them to 'steer clear'.   Greater Manchester Police confiscated a bag of the group's branded 'Invicted Foundation' wrist-bands and said that they would prosecute them for breaking street trading laws and the Uniform Act.",

He has said he will reverse that trend as president.       The president-elect is spending the holidays at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where he's been holding meetings with senior staff, advisers and business executives.

But one number almost always goes unheard: more than 1,030 seats.   That's the number of spots in state legislatures, governor's mansions and Congress lost by Democrats during Obama's presidency.   The statistic reveals an unexpected twist of the Obama years: the leadership of the former community organizer  was rough on the grassroots of his own party.     'What's happened on the ground is that voters have been punishing Democrats for eight solid years \u2014 it's been exhausting,' South Carolina state Senator Vincent Sheheen said. He lost two gubernatorial campaigns to Nikki Haley, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for ambassador to the UN.   'If I was talking about a local or state issue, voters would always lapse back into a national topic: Barack Obama.'   Obama's election was heralded as a moment of Democratic dominance \u2014 the crashing of a conservative wave that had swept the country since the dawn of the Reagan era.   Democrats believed that the coalition of young, minority and female voters who swept Obama into the White House would usher in something new: an ascendant Democratic majority that would ensure party gains for decades to come.   The coalition, it turns out, was Obama's alone.   After this year's elections, Democrats hold the governor's office and both legislative chambers in just five coastal states: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware. Republicans have the trifecta in 25, giving them control of a broad swath of the middle of the country.   The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP majority eager to undo many of the president's policies.   To be sure, the president's party almost always loses seats in midterm elections. But, according to experts, Obama's tenure has marked the greatest number of losses under any president in decades.   'Obama just figured his important actions on policies like immigration and health care would solidify support, but that hasn't really materialized,' said Daniel Galvin, a political science professor at Northwestern University and the author of a book on presidential party building.   'He's done basically the minimal amount of party building, and it's been insufficient to help the party.'   Obama has acknowledged this publicly only after his party's devastating November losses. He's admitted he failed to create 'a sustaining organization' around the political force that twice elected him to office.   'That's something I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're also dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House,' he said at his year-end press conference.   It is perhaps not surprising that Obama \u2014 a politician who promised a post-party era \u2014 turned out not to be a party stalwart.   Obama and his aides came into office neither beholden to his party's establishment, nor particularly interested in reinforcing his party's weak spots.   He electrified the 2004 Democratic National Convention with a speech seeking common cause over party differences. Four years later, he defeated Hillary Clinton, the pick of the party insiders, to win the Democratic presidential nomination.   In the White House, Obama's failure to do the typical Washington schmoozing was a constant source of complaint among congressional Democrats. The same was true for  his reluctance to endorse down-ballot candidates and inability to parlay Organizing for Action, his grassroots organization, into a significant force.   State parties languished and the Democratic National Committee struggled with dysfunction and debt.   'We built this beautiful house, but the foundation is rotten,' said South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison, a candidate to lead the Democratic National Committee. 'In hindsight we should have looked at this and said, 'Maybe the state parties should be strong.''   Toward the end of his presidency, Obama began doing more, stepping in to assist more than 150 state legislative candidates in October and campaigning across the country for Clinton.   He's indicated he intends to make partisan politics a bigger piece of his post-presidential life. Aides say Obama will be closely involved in an effort to focus on drawing district lines more in the favor of Democrats.   The president's advisers blame the losses on such structural trends. They point to a flood of Republican super PAC dollars and a resurgence of Republican political power in statehouses. That state-level dominance has given Republicans the ability to redraw district lines and created voting rules that could benefit their party for years to come.   The refusal by many Democrats to accept help from Obama in the 2010 and 2014 midterms was also a strategic mistake, they argue.   'Frankly, when people have asked, the president has been more than willing to engage,' Obama's political director David Simas said.   Some Democrats blame Obama for an executive agenda that highlighted social issues \u2014 such as transgender rights and access to birth control \u2014 over the economic anxiety still felt by many voters.   'The backlash to the Obama presidency was perhaps bigger than any of us really realized,' said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network, a Democratic think tank.   'A lot of the story of this election was people feeling like the culture was evolving in a way that made it feel like they were no longer living in the country they grew up in.'   Others are focusing on the one clear truth of the November defeats: what worked for Obama just did not work for this party.   Perhaps the most remarkable twist of a shocking political season? Even as voters chose to elect a successor who vows to undo most of Obama's legacy, his approval rating remains the highest it's been since the spring of 2009.",

The resolution passed thanks to a U.S. abstention, a decision Netanyahu has described as a \u201cshameful ambush.\u201d \n The White House already has acknowledged President Obama made the decision for U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power to abstain. Unclear was how involved the Obama administration was in crafting and pushing the resolution itself \u2013 which initially was put forward by Egypt, and then pursued by New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela. \n White House spokesman Eric Schultz issued a statement Sunday defending Obama's support for Israel and stressed that the U.S. did not draft the resolution. \n \"The Egyptians, in partnership with the Palestinians, are the ones who began circulating an earlier draft of the resolution,\" Schultz said. \"The Egyptians are the ones who moved it forward on Friday. And we took the position that we did when it was put to a vote.\"  \n Keyes' criticism followed similar rhetoric by Netanyahu himself, who said that while the U.S. and Israel for decades had disagreed on settlements, they had an understanding that such action before the U.N. Security Council would make peace negotiations harder. \n \u201cAs I told [Secretary of State] John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d Netanyahu said. \n He pointedly said he looks forward to working with the new Donald Trump administration when it takes office next month. He said he was encouraged by Israel\u2019s \u201cfriends in the United States\u201d who criticized the resolution, saying \u201cthey understand how reckless and destructive\u201d it is.  \n Keyes also told Fox News on Sunday that Israel was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the resolution and the Obama administration\u2019s abstention. \n \n \n \n \n Expand / Contract \n \n \n \n President-elect Donald Trump\n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                         (AP) \n \n \n \n \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is an abandonment of Israel, and an abandonment of a long-standing American policy,\u201d he said. \n Israel's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said it began summoning the ambassadors of countries who voted in favor of the resolution, including those from the permanent members of the Security Council -- Russia, China, the U.K. and France. In a highly unusual move, the U.S. ambassador was later summoned as well, Israeli media reported.  \n \"We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision,\" Netanyahu said. \n The resolution, which condemned Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, sparked outrage in Israel and led to a new low in relations between Netanyahu and Obama. Israel has accused Obama of colluding with the Palestinians against the Jewish state. \n \n \n \n \n \n The resolution's immediate impact appears to be largely symbolic, but Israel fears it could open the door to an increase in international steps, including economic measures. Much of the international community considers the settlements illegal or illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. \n In addition to the measures declared Sunday, Israel has recalled its ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal for consultations and canceled a planned January visit to Israel by Senegal's foreign minister. A visit by Ukraine's prime minister has also been canceled in light of its support for the U.N. vote and Israel has pledged to cut millions of shekels in funding to certain U.N. agencies. \n President-elect Trump had intervened last week after the Israelis reportedly appealed to him for help. Trump came out against the resolution but, after a vote was delayed, the Security Council went ahead with consideration and approved it on Friday. \n Trump tweeted afterward: \u201cThings will be different after Jan. 20 .\u201d  He later tweeted that the vote \"will make it much harder to negotiate peace.\" But, he added, \"we will get it done anyway.\" \n Kerry said Israel\u2019s continued and stepped-up attempts to build more settlements in the region, which includes East Jerusalem, risks the so-called \u201ctwo-state\u201d solution between Israelis and the Palestinians, who also lay claim to the region.  \n \u201cThe United States acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution, which every U.S. administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\" Kerry said Friday. \u201cTwo states is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors, and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.\u201d \n He also said the administration does not agree with \u201cevery aspect\u201d of the resolution but that it \u201crightly condemns violence\u201d and calls on both sides to take constructive steps to reverse current trends and advance the prospects for a two-state solution. \n Netanyahu did not mince words on Saturday in responding to what he described as a \u201cshameful ambush.\u201d \n Netanyahu said the U.S abstention was \"in complete contrast\" to U.S. commitments -- including one that he said Obama made in 2011 -- not to impose conditions for a final agreement on Israel at the Security Council. \"The Obama administration conducted a shameful anti-Israel ambush at the U.N.,\" Netanyahu said. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

A 100-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 83 between Bismarck and Minot also was closed due to drifting snow and near-zero visibility.   \n Up to a 1/2 inch of ice could accumulate in central Minnesota, and the weather service has said anyone who \"must travel\" should have an extra flashlight, food and water.   \n Meteorologist Bill Abeling of the Bismarck NWS office told the Bismarck Tribune that ice accumulation was reportedly causing power outages near Jamestown and Verona.   \n In southeast Nebraska, high winds were cited as the likely cause of about 800 Omaha Public Power District customers losing power Sunday, the Omaha World-Reported.   \n Rain and possible storms were due to move through parts of Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska on Sunday.",

For several days after the discovery of the body, tied to a concrete post used to attach buoys, the identity of the man, wearing a full wet suit and flippers, had remained a mystery.   No-one had come forward to report a Westerner missing but shopkeepers on the island said after looking at photos of the dead man that they believed he had visited their stores and had been speaking Russian.   But police in Pattaya have now confirmed his identity and nationality - and also located his Thai wife with whom he had been living in Bangkok.   However, police said he had traveled to Pattaya alone, leaving her behind in Bangkok while he checked into a hotel in the sleazy resort town.   CCTV images suggested that the American had visited a store in the town with a woman who was not his wife - although police said it was possible that the woman in the images was not actually with Mr Kech.   Located in Bangkok, Mr Kech's wife - who has not been named - confirmed they had been living together in Bangkok but her husband had traveled to Pattaya alone and had checked into a hotel on Second Road.   Thai media, including  Pattaya One  and the  Bangkok Post , reported that Mr Kech's wife told police that her husband had said to her many times that he wanted to die because he did not want to grow old and weak.   He wanted to end his life while he was still strong, she allegedly claimed to police.   According to police who had examined CCTV footage, Mr Ketch went to Bali Hai Pier alone at 7am on the morning of December 14.   When he was found tied to the post, his only injury was the severe gash to his throat. There were no other signs of violence.   Police divers found diving goggles and, more pertinently, a box cutter knife on the sea bed near where the body was located.   Officials said that based on this evidence, it was believed Mr Kech had tied a back pack he was wearing to the pier pole so that his body would not be washed out to sea before he then cut his own throat.",

Indeed, unwitting ramblers have been known to wander into its grounds thinking they are visiting a place of worship.   Inside the Grade II listed stone church there is limestone flooring, high vaulted ceilings, exposed timbers and stained glass windows.   The main reception space has many of the church's original and character features and is split over two levels with a formal drawing room and a more relaxed sitting area.   There is also a kitchen, dining room, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a study in what would have been the vestry, with windows overlooking the original churchyard where there are still a number of gravestones.   Bartholomews sits on the edge of the pretty village and has stunning views across the fields.   The church dates back to the 12th century although there is not much trace left of the original building. In 1879 what was left of it was demolished and rebuilt.   The last service at the church took place on Palm Sunday in 1966 and it closed as a place of worship in 1991.   The property is on the market with estate agents Knight Frank.   A Knight Frank spokesman said: 'Bartholomews is a beautifully presented home which has been designed with modern techniques and contemporary styling to make the most of the unique space whilst also retaining a wealth of the church's original features and feel.   'The dining area benefits from a triple height vaulted ceiling, stained glass windows, exposed timbers and sandstone walls.   'But it is in the substantial main reception space that you get the feel for church's past. There are window seats to provide lovely vistas over the garden and fields beyond and the study lies within the original vestry.'",

The undercover officers arranged to pick up the baby apes outside a Bangkok supermarket on December 21, where the orange-furred creatures were delivered by a city taxi driver.   The driver was arrested but cleared after authorities determined he was not part of the smuggling gang, according to wildlife police officer Anothorn Srithongbai.   'As far as the real trafficker goes, that's still under investigation,' he added.   Orangutans are native to Malaysia and Indonesia but they are often illegally smuggled throughout Southeast Asia, either for private zoos or as pets.   Thailand has long served as a transit hub for contraband wildlife products bound for major markets like Vietnam and China.   Counter-trafficking organisation Freeland, which assisted with the orangutan rescue, said the attempted sale was linked to a 'major regional criminal syndicate' involved in the lucrative illegal wildlife trade.   Matthew Pritchett from Freeland said social media has become an integral tool for such gangs to set up sales.   'This case is one link in a much larger chain,' he added.",

However she does suggests you drink small quantities of water throughout the day to keep hydrated.   Otherwise, your body holds on to what it has and this can lead to bloating.   Rob Hobson, Healthspan Head of Nutrition, recommends sipping on soothing teas like camomile, ginger or peppermint.   'Peppermint is particularly useful as it helps relax the digestive tract,' he says.   'Ginger is helpful if you feel nauseous. Make a big pot of tea with either fresh ginger or mint and sip slowly.' No fresh ginger or mint in the house? Ginger or mint teabags are fine.   AFTER 15 MINUTES   Tempting as it may be to slump on the sofa, try to keep upright.   Take the dishes through to the kitchen, take the kids/dog in the garden \u2013 just resist the urge to take your uncomfortably large belly for a lie down, says Dr Arroll.   This is because lying down will slow down your digestion \u2013 and can trigger the dreaded heartburn.   If you are suffering with indigestion or heartburn, a good homemade remedy for neutralising stomach acid is half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda mixed in a glass of warm water.   While it will be too late for today, there are other remedies that are worth having in stock in the future.   A good stomach calming product is Silicolgel, a liquid that forms a soothing coating over the lining of the stomach and intestines.   It also helps reduce excess acidity \u2013 and can help wind problems from either end. You can also take it as a preventative measure before you start eating.    Alternatively, try an artichoke supplement.   'I believe artichoke is one of the best supplements to ease feeling bloated,' says GP and medical nutritionist Dr Sarah Brewer.   'This is because it rapidly increases the liver's production of bile to improve digestion. It can be taken before or after a big dinner.'   Try Healthspan's Artichoke supplement, \u00a39.45 for 120 tablets.   AFTER 30 MINUTES   Now is the time to take a stroll, says Dr Arroll, as this will help stimulate your digestion and make you feel less full and bloated.   If you are sitting around not doing much, then your digestive system tends to slow down with you.   But rest assured, couch potatoes - a 10-15 minute walk is enough.   Anything more strenuous like running is likely to make you feel nauseous.   'Plus you want to give your enough time to absorb nutrients from your food,' says Dr Arroll.   And avoid fizzy or carbonated drinks like cola, prosecco or fizzy water, as these will simply make you feel more bloated and increase your risk of indigestion.   AN HOUR LATER   If your stomach is still feeling tender, then a gentle massage and deep breathing could help.   Yantra Yoga teacher and therapist John Renshaw, from London's Kailash Centre, a complementary and alternative health and healing centre, suggests 'massaging the belly gently in a clockwise direction to help encourage space in the colon'.   Do around 40-50 circles or simply massage for several minutes to help improve digestion.   He also says deep abdominal breathing \u2013 taking in slow, low, deep breaths from the abdomen to a count of 10 and exhaling slowly and completely for a similar count \u2013 will help to both de-stress you and calm your stomach.   He recommends you do this for up to five minutes.   TWO \u2013THREE HOURS LATER   If you still feel the need for a lie down, then your food should have digested enough for you to go horizontal without the risk of acid reflux, says Dr Arroll.   But if you suffer regularly with acid reflux, then experts suggest you prop your head up while you sleep to relieve symptoms.   You can do this with several pillows or elevate the head of your bed by putting pillows or cushioning underneath the mattress to raise it up. Sleeping on your side can also help alleviate symptoms.   FIVE-SIX HOURS LATER   If yours was a lunchtime blowout then this is probably time the leftovers will appear.   If you aren't hungry, try and resist eating for the sake of it, or because the food is there, because it will only make you feel worse.   But, says Rob Hobson, if you do fancy something, 'think small portions and go easy with the fatty, rich foods as these take the longest to digest.   And eat slowly. Lean turkey with leftover vegetables or a light salad are a good choice.   THE NEXT DAY   Start the day with a cup of warm water and lemon juice. This should help detoxify you and act as a liver tonic.   Rob Hobson says, 'Don't skip meals because your overdid it yesterday \u2013 think small balanced meals with protein and fibre instead.   And try de-bloating fruits like papaya and pineapple which contain an enzyme that helps aid digestion.   A breakfast of papaya/pineapple and probiotic-rich plain unsweetened yogurt is good.   'Then for lunch, a light chicken/turkey or vegetable soup - with its high water and vegetable content - should help your digestive system recover,' he adds.",

   "7. content": "Christmas. The time of year when it's perfectly fine to tuck into sweets, biscuits and a generous helping of roast potatoes.   But just because the festive period is one of indulgence, doesn't mean you have to put on weight.   Celebrity weight loss expert Louise Parker says it's possible to stay slim and healthy without sacrificing certain foods.   Here, in a MailOnline exclusive, she reveals the seven best foods to boost your metabolism - preventing you from piling on the pounds this Christmas.     If you look after your metabolism, you give your body the very best chance at keeping fat at arms length.    This should be the starting point of anyone serious about wanting to achieve and hang on to a fit and healthy body.    Your metabolism plays a massive role in keeping you lean for life, although each has its limits.    Whether it's strong or sluggish, you still have to choose really intelligently about the types of foods and the portions that you eat.   No mater how 'super', organic, gluten free, and every other 'healthy halo' promise emblazoned on the label, you still really do need to read it.   The good news is you can manipulate your metabolism. All it really refers to is how much muscle mass you have on your body.   The higher percentage of lean muscle mass you have, the greater your metabolism and the more calories your body can burn throughout the day, before sending it off to fat storage.    Muscle requires calories to sustain it, whilst body fat simply sits there. You have to eat protein.    There\u2019s no need to live on endless amounts of meat either. Eating protein little and often just keeps your metabolism ticking over beautifully.    It\u2019s a great idea to have some in the fridge, freezer and store cupboard so that you never get caught out.     GREEK YOGHURT     One of my absolute essentials as it's so flexible.    As it's strained, it's packed full of dairy protein and makes a wonderful base for birchers, protein smoothies and simple yoghurt based breakfasts, served with my two minute sugar free berry sauce compote.   Don't shy away from dairy unless you truly are lactose intolerant as it's a brilliant protein source and super high in calcium which studies prove aids fat loss.   SALMON   Salmon is a real favourite and packed with Omega oils.    Not only are these compounds known to be beneficial for the metabolism, but Omega 3 has been found to reduce the risk of a heart attack.   The oil does increase the calories so your portion of salmon should be smaller than your portion of a fat free protein, such as turkey.    Don't obsess over it, but just bear it in mind. Sardines, mackerel and anchovies are a wonderful addition to salads too \u2013 fresh or tinned are fine   TOFU, TEMPEH AND EDAMAME   Soya is a fabulous vegan protein \u2013 I keep edamame beans in the freezer for snacks or dosing up a stir fryor salad if the fridge is running low.    Firm tofu is fabulous in Asian stir fries as it's very mild taste is a sponge for flavour such as garlic, ginger and fresh herbs.    Silken tofu is a wonderful base for a protein smoothie too if you don't eat dairy or like to use protein powders   EGGS   Eggs are just so versatile and contain the most brilliant array of nutrients \u2013 many of which are lacking in the modern day diet.    They pack a punch with protein and are a great source of B vitamins, Vitamin A and a decent amount of D, E, calcium and zinc.    They do contain cholesterol but I've never seen a client's bad cholesterol go up following our method a whole. So don't skip the yolk.    My husband has a dozen a week and I've not upped his life insurance.    Great for fritatta's, omelettes and thrown on a quick bubble and squeak to up the amino acid content.    I store mine in the fridge and buy the best I can afford \u2013 Clarence Court are my favourites.   CHEESE   It's an easy one to strike off your 'healthy' list if you're watching your weight, but don't write it off.    Low fat cheeses such as quark, cottage cheese, paneer and other mild forms are bland but provide a great base for adding in other flavours.   I love cinnamon and cottage cheese on a cracker as a snack when you need a little sweet crunch.    Higher fat cheeses such as goats cheese, mature cheddar, Parmesan are a great way of adding a good dose of flavour to a meal, using a just a tablespoon \u2013 so you get great flavour for your buck.    I often toss some Parmesan into a quick omelette or toss feta into a salad more as a seasoning than a main ingredient.    RED MEAT   Beef, venison, lean lamb and even pork are all brilliant forms of protein.    There's a lot to be said for meat and two veg \u2013 but you don't need to cook it the way our grandmothers did.    Season well and play around with ready prepped seasoning. Classic roasts, slow cooking, stir-frying and slow roasting are my favourite ways of infusing meats with flavour.    I tend to eat red meats three to four times a week.    Beef is a favourite of mine and if it's grass fed will be a great source of CLA (conjugated lineoic acid, which helps us hang on to muscle mass whilst we are shredding body fat \u2013 more effective in people who are obese rather than a little overweight).     WHITE MEAT   Chicken and turkey are mainstays in my home and probably the most versatile of proteins.    I roast a chicken each weekend and make stock straight away for a Monday night soup.    Minced turkey is wonderful for making patties with fresh herbs and wonderful simply stir-fried with some Asian vegetables and Thai basil.    My children love bashing the living daylights out of little chicken fillets between clingfilm, which I roll in egg, a little wholemeal flour and Parmesan and bake in the oven for a quick mid week supper.

Protestors slammed Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Islamist Ennahda party, who has in the past supported the idea of allowing Tunisian jihadists who 'repent' and renounce violence to return home.   President Beji Caid Essebsi said earlier this month that Tunisia would refuse to pardon Tunisians who fight for jihadist organisations.   'Many of them want to return, and we can't prevent a Tunisian from returning to his country,' he said. 'But we will be vigilant.'   Following a storm of criticism in the press and on social media, on December 15 he told Tunisian local television that 'we will not be indulgent with the terrorists'.   More than 5,000 Tunisians are fighting for jihadist groups abroad, mainly in Iraq, Syria or neighbouring Libya, according to a UN working group on mercenaries.   On Friday evening, the country's Interior Minister Hedi Majdoub told parliament 800 Tunisian nationals who had fought for extremist groups abroad had since returned to the country.   Since its 2011 revolution Tunisia has faced repeated jihadist attacks, killing more than 100 soldiers and policemen, as well as about 20 civilians and 59 foreign tourists, according to official figures.   Monday   Between 3pm and 4pm: Polish lorry driver Lukasz Urban, 37, has his lorry hijacked. He was on his way back to his truck from a kebab shop when he was ambushed.   8pm - The truck is driven into a large crowd of people at outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the centre of Berlin. Urban's body was found in the passenger seat after the attackers fled. He had been shot and stabbed, but authorities believe he was alive when the truck ploughed into the crowd. Twelve people were killed and 50 more were injured.   9pm - A Pakistani man is arrested a mile-and-a-half from the scene, after witnesses claimed to have seen him leaving the truck. It was revealed that he had entered Germany under a false name in February.   10.16pm - Controversial far-right activist Lutz Bachmann, who heads the anti-immigrant PEGIDA group, tweeted on Monday night that he had 'internal police information' that the perpetrator was a Tunisian.    Tuesday   4am - Police raid a refugee camp at Tempelhof, believed to be where the Pakistani suspect resided.    8am - The suspect is named as Naved B, a 23-year-old man from Pakistan, but police later reveal that the man has denied any involvement in the attack and urged people to be vigilant.   10am - German chancellor Angela Merkel confirms the attack is being treated as an act of terrorism.   12pm - Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, confirms that  18 of the 50 people hurt in the attack were 'very seriously injured'.   1.20pm - Police admit that they have arrested the wrong man. A senior officer says: 'The true perpetrator is still armed, at large and can cause fresh damage.'   6.50pm - Authorities confirm that the wrongly-arrested man has been released.   ISIS claims responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement which describes the lorry driver as a 'soldier' and praised him for 'targeting nationals of the coalition countries'.   Wednesday   It is revealed that police are looking for a Tunisian man, named as Anis Amri, after his ID was found under the driver's seat. It emerged that the failed asylum seeker, who had a 100,000 euro reward on his head, had been under the surveillance of German intelligence for several months, and  had been arrested three times this year, but deportation papers were never served. Reports in Germany suggest intelligence services had lost track of him weeks ago.   A cousin of Naveed Baluch, the wrongly accused suspect, was 'mentally unfit' and had not been heard from since he was released. His cousin Waheed told MailOnline he was 'very worried' about the missing man.    Thursday   An Israeli woman became the first named victim of the Berlin lorry massacre. Dalia Elyakim, from Herzliya, Israel, was with her husband Rami when the atrocity happened. Rami was in hospital fighting for his life.    The market where the massacre happened reopened, with heightened security. Stalls on Breitscheidplatz square opened again three days after the 25-tonne lorry was used as a weapon to kill and maim shoppers.    Two of Amri\u2019s brothers, Walid and Abdelkader, said they believed he had been radicalised in prison in Italy, and Abdelkader told reporers: 'I ask him to turn himself in to the police. If it is proved that he is involved, we dissociate ourselves from it.'   Two men were arrested after a police raid at a mosque in Berlin's Moabit neighbourhood, where Amri was allegedly captured on CCTV just eight hours after the mass killing.   Friday   3am - Amri was shot dead in Milan. He immediately produced a gun when approached by police. In a press conference at 9.45am, the Italian Interior minister, Marco Minniti, said Amri immediately produced a gun when approached by police and shot an officer during a routine patrol. The Tunisian was then killed, and there is 'absolutely no doubt' that the man was Amri, Minniti said.   It has emerged that German police are linking Amri to the murder of a 16-year-old German boy in Hamburg two months ago. ISIS claimed responsibility for the October 16 knife attack which killed the teenager, identified by authorities as Victor E. He has also previously been jailed in his native Tunisia for hijacking a truck.   Saturday   Authorities in Tunisia announce that three men, including Amri's 18-year-old nephew, have been arrested in connection with a terror cell believed to be linked to the Berlin truck killer.",

On this day full of light, the prophetic proclamation resounds: \"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. And the government will be upon his shoulder; and his name will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" (Is 9:6) \n The power of this Child, Son of God and Son of Mary, is not the power of this world, based on might and wealth; it is the power of love. It is the power that created the heavens and the earth, and gives life to all creation: to minerals, plants and animals. \n It is the force that attracts man and woman, and makes them one flesh, one single existence. It is the power that gives new birth, forgives sin, reconciles enemies, and transforms evil into good. It is the power of God. \n This power of love led Jesus Christ to strip himself of his glory and become man; it led him to give his life on the cross and to rise from the dead. It is the power of service, which inaugurates in our world the Kingdom of God, a kingdom of justice and peace. \n For this reason, the birth of Jesus was accompanied by the angels' song as they proclaimed: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!\" (Lk 2:14). \n Today this message goes out to the ends of the earth to reach all peoples, especially those scarred by war and harsh conflicts that seem stronger than the yearning for peace. \n Peace to men and women in the war-torn land of Syria, where far too much blood has been spilled. Particularly in Aleppo, the site of horrendous fighting in recent weeks, it is most urgent that, in respect for humanitarian law, assistance and support be guaranteed to the sorely tried civilian population, who continue to live in desperate straits and immense suffering and need. It is time for weapons to be still forever, and the international community to seek actively a negotiated solution, so that civil coexistence can be restored in the country. \n Peace to the women and men of the beloved Holy Land, the land chosen and favored by God. May Israelis and Palestinians have the courage and determination to write a new page of history, where hate and revenge give way to the will to build together a future of mutual understanding and harmony. \n May Iraq, Libya and Yemen - whose peoples suffer war and the brutality of terrorism - be able once again to find unity and concord. \n Peace to the men and women in various parts of Africa, especially in Nigeria, where fundamentalist terrorism exploits even children in order to perpetrate horror and death. Peace in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, so that divisions may be healed and all people of good will may strive to undertake the path of development and sharing, preferring the culture of dialogue to the mindset of conflict. \n Peace to women and men who to this day suffer the consequences of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, where there is urgent need for a common desire to bring relief to the civil population and to put into practice the commitments which have been assumed. \n We implore harmony for the dear people of Colombia, which seeks to embark on a new and courageous path of dialogue and reconciliation. May such courage also motivate the beloved country of Venezuela to undertake the necessary steps to put an end to current tensions, and build together a future of hope for the whole population. \n Peace to all who, in different areas, are enduring sufferings due to constant dangers and persistent injustice. \n May Myanmar consolidate its efforts to promote peaceful coexistence and, with the assistance of the international community, provide necessary protection and humanitarian assistance to all those so gravely and urgently in need of it. May the Korean peninsula see the tensions it is experiencing overcome in a renewed spirit of collaboration. \n Peace to all who have been injured or have suffered the loss of a loved one due to the brutal acts of terrorism that have sown fear and death in the heart of many countries and cities. \n Peace - not merely the word, but real and concrete peace - to our abandoned and excluded brothers and sisters, to those who suffer hunger and to all the victims of violence. \n Peace to exiles, migrants and refugees, to all those who in our day are subject to human trafficking. \n Peace to the peoples who suffer because of the economic ambitions of a few, because of sheer greed and the idolatry of money, which leads to slavery. \n Peace to those affected by social and economic unrest, and to those who endure the consequences of earthquakes or other natural catastrophes. \n And peace to the children, on this special day on which God became a child, above all those deprived of the joys of childhood because of hunger, wars or the selfishness of adults. \n Peace on earth to men and women of goodwill, who work quietly and patiently each day, in their families and in society, to build a more humane and just world, sustained by the conviction that only with peace is there the possibility of a more prosperous future for all. \n Dear brothers and sisters, \"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given;\" he is the \"prince of peace.\" Let us welcome him!",

Pakistan and Israel both have nuclear arsenals.   Mr Asif appeared to accept the article at face value, despite the fact that it mentioned Israel's former defence minister, Moshe Yaalon, rather than Avigdor Lieberman, who took over in May.   Israel's Defence Ministry responded to Mr Asif's tweet, denying the Israeli defence minister had made the original statement cited in the fake news article.   'The statement attributed to fmr Def Min Yaalon re Pakistan was never said,' the Israeli Defence Ministry on its official Twitter account.    'Reports referred to by the Pakistani Def Min are entirely false,' it added.   Senior police officers, politicians and journalists have become increasingly worried about the phenomenon of fake news in recent months.    Earlier this month a man was arrested for firing a gun in a pizza restaurant in Washington DC, having reportedly come to investigate a bogus story about the pizzeria being at the heart of a child sex slave ring linked to Hillary Clinton.    AWD News has a reputation for promoting clickbait and conspiracy theories, including that King Abdullah of Jordan murdered his wife Queen Rania, who is in fact alive and well.",

   "7. content": "Berliners have called for more CCTV cameras in the wake of the Christmas market terrorist attack.   A survey carried out following the murder of 11 people by Anis Amri showed 83 per cent of those in the German capital wanted extra surveillance in public areas.   It also found that 68 per cent wanted a rethink on Germany's immigration policy after Tunisian and ISIS fanatic Amri drove a 35-tonne lorry into shoppers on Monday.   Europe's most wanted man was shot dead in Milan four days later, raising questions as to how he was able to evade detection despite crossing into France and Italy.   The research, carried out by the Emnid research institute on behalf of German newspaper  Bild am Sonntag , also found 11 per cent would now avoid public events.   In contrast, 84 per cent of those polled said they wouldn't change their habits and behaviour in the wake of the attack.   In a show of defiance, five per cent even claimed that they wanted to visit busier areas more frequently as a result of the mass killing.   CCTV footage of the attack has yet to be published, despite the atrocity taking place in one of the busiest public spaces in the city.   The use of surveillance cameras is considered to be much more restrictive than in similar Western countries due to its strict privacy laws.   However new legislation has been proposed to increase CCTV use in public places such as shopping centres, notably in the aftermath of July's Munich shootings.       German authorities launched a Europe-wide manhunt for Amri on Wednesday. Two days later the rejected asylum seeker was killed by Italian police in Milan.   Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti said that Amri had been fatally shot after firing at police who had stopped him for a routine identity check around 3am.   Amri had been missing since escaping after Monday's attack in central Berlin. He had links to Italy, having arrived in the country from his native Tunisia in 2011.   Amri's temporary residence permit for Germany and fingerprints were found in the cab of the truck he rammed into the packed Christmas market.   But in a development that stoked public anger, it emerged that German officials had already been investigating Amri.   Prosecutors in Berlin believed he was planning a burglary to raise funds to buy weapons, possibly to carry out an attack.   However, after trailing him for six months, they had to let the case drop due to a lack of evidence against him - they thought he was only a small-time drug dealer.   Questions were also raised on Friday about how Amri managed to flee Germany, evading the Europe-wide manhunt and making it all the way to Italy.   He is believed to have travelled at least part of the route by train, passing through France. He had no phone on him and only a few hundred euros.      Amri left Tunisia and moved to Italy in 2011, serving a four-year sentence there for setting fire to a school which had been converted into a refugee shelter.   Security sources believe Amri was radicalised during his time in prison. He arrived in Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum, which was rejected in June.   However, his deportation became bogged down in red tape as Tunisia denied he was a citizen.   Just an hour after the carnage, the police declared they had a chief suspect already in custody, a Pakistani asylum seeker.   Police released him 24 hours later, after failing to find evidence of his involvement. The mix-up gave Amri another 30 hours to flee.       After the bloody assault, the Islamic State-linked Amaq news agency hailed Amri as a 'soldier' of the group.     After Amri was shot dead, ISIS released a video in which he is shown pledging allegiance to group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.   Tunisia  said it had arrested Amri's nephew and two other men who were members of a 'terrorist cell'. It made no direct link between the trio and the Berlin attack.    The truck used to carry out the attack belonged to Polish driver Lukasz Urban, who was heading to Berlin to deliver steel beams from Italy.   But the delivery was put off until the following day, so he went to park his Polish-registered lorry in an industrial zone in the northwest of the city.    Police found Urban, shot dead, in the passenger seat of the truck's cab.   According to Urban's cousin Ariel Zurawski, who was shown photos of the body, the 37-year-old had a stab wound and 'his face was bloodied and swollen'.   Eleven other people were also killed, seven of them German nationals. The others came from Czech Republic, Italy, Israel and Ukraine.   Monday   Between 3pm and 4pm: Polish lorry driver Lukasz Urban, 37, has his lorry hijacked. He was on his way back to his truck from a kebab shop when he was ambushed.   8pm - The truck is driven into a large crowd of people at outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the centre of Berlin. Urban's body was found in the passenger seat after the attackers fled. He had been shot and stabbed, but authorities believe he was alive when the truck ploughed into the crowd. Twelve people were killed and 50 more were injured.   9pm - A Pakistani man is arrested a mile-and-a-half from the scene, after witnesses claimed to have seen him leaving the truck. It was revealed that he had entered Germany under a false name in February.   10.16pm - Controversial far-right activist Lutz Bachmann, who heads the anti-immigrant PEGIDA group, tweeted on Monday night that he had 'internal police information' that the perpetrator was a Tunisian.    Tuesday   4am - Police raid a refugee camp at Tempelhof, believed to be where the Pakistani suspect resided.    8am - The suspect is named as Naved B, a 23-year-old man from Pakistan, but police later reveal that the man has denied any involvement in the attack and urged people to be vigilant.   10am - German chancellor Angela Merkel confirms the attack is being treated as an act of terrorism.   12pm - Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, confirms that  18 of the 50 people hurt in the attack were 'very seriously injured'.   1.20pm - Police admit that they have arrested the wrong man. A senior officer says: 'The true perpetrator is still armed, at large and can cause fresh damage.'   6.50pm - Authorities confirm that the wrongly-arrested man has been released.   ISIS claims responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement which describes the lorry driver as a 'soldier' and praised him for 'targeting nationals of the coalition countries'.   Wednesday   It is revealed that police are looking for a Tunisian man, named as Anis Amri, after his ID was found under the driver's seat. It emerged that the failed asylum seeker, who had a 100,000 euro reward on his head, had been under the surveillance of German intelligence for several months, and  had been arrested three times this year, but deportation papers were never served. Reports in Germany suggest intelligence services had lost track of him weeks ago.   A cousin of Naveed Baluch, the wrongly accused suspect, was 'mentally unfit' and had not been heard from since he was released. His cousin Waheed told MailOnline he was 'very worried' about the missing man.    Thursday   An Israeli woman became the first named victim of the Berlin lorry massacre. Dalia Elyakim, from Herzliya, Israel, was with her husband Rami when the atrocity happened. Rami was in hospital fighting for his life.    The market where the massacre happened reopened, with heightened security. Stalls on Breitscheidplatz square opened again three days after the 25-tonne lorry was used as a weapon to kill and maim shoppers.    Two of Amri\u2019s brothers, Walid and Abdelkader, said they believed he had been radicalised in prison in Italy, and Abdelkader told reporers: 'I ask him to turn himself in to the police. If it is proved that he is involved, we dissociate ourselves from it.'   Two men were arrested after a police raid at a mosque in Berlin's Moabit neighbourhood, where Amri was allegedly captured on CCTV just eight hours after the mass killing.   Friday   3am - Amri was shot dead in Milan. He immediately produced a gun when approached by police. In a press conference at 9.45am, the Italian Interior minister, Marco Minniti, said Amri immediately produced a gun when approached by police and shot an officer during a routine patrol. The Tunisian was then killed, and there is 'absolutely no doubt' that the man was Amri, Minniti said.   It has emerged that German police are linking Amri to the murder of a 16-year-old German boy in Hamburg two months ago. ISIS claimed responsibility for the October 16 knife attack which killed the teenager, identified by authorities as Victor E. He has also previously been jailed in his native Tunisia for hijacking a truck.   Saturday   Authorities in Tunisia announce that three men, including Amri's 18-year-old nephew, have been arrested in connection with a terror cell believed to be linked to the Berlin truck killer.",

Thanabalasingham's 11-year-old daughter and 69-year-old father-in-law escaped the inferno, which tore through the Flat Bush home on the early hours of Thursday.    Friends and family are keeping vigil at hospital to support Thanabalasingham.   A Givealittle crowdfunding page launched to help the family has raised over $64,000.   You can donate  here",

   "7. content": "The Duke and  Duchess of Cambridge  stepped out with their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte for a Christmas morning church service.   This comes as other members of the family gather for one of the highlights in the royal calendar - their annual church service at Sandringham.   In a break from tradition, William and Kate have this year chosen to spend the holidays with her parents, Michael and Carol Middleton, at their home in the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire, some 170 miles away from the Sandringham estate.   The pair and their children were joined by Kate's parents and brother James as well as her newly-engaged sister Pippa Middleton and James Matthews for the service at St Mark's Church in Englefield, Berkshire - where Pippa is set to marry next year.    This is the second time William and Kate have spent time with the Middleton family over Christmas.    In 2012, Kate was suffering with severe morning sickness while pregnant with Prince George so stayed with her parents.    In another unusual move for the family, Kate and William chose to take their children along to church this morning - a move they would not usually make at Sandringham.    Prince George and Princess Charlotte attended their first Christmas communion service at the 12th century St Mark's Church in Englefield near the Middleton family home.   Bells rang as the Royals arrived outside the church where some 100 smiling locals were seen entering for its 10.30am Sunday service.   Prince George walked along holding his father's hand while and Princess Charlotte was carried in her mother's arms.   Prince William could be seen talking animatedly to his son as they strolled through the church yard, as the youngster wrapped up warm against the cold wind in a smart grey woollen coat.    Princess Charlotte looked adorable as she wore a navy coat accessorised with thick red tights and a red ribbon in her hair.   As they attended the Christmas service this morning, the Duchess of Cambridge and her children wrapped up warm in their festive coordinating outfits.    The Duchess of Cambridge dressed Prince George in a \u00a3120 Pepa & Co wool coat. Similar garments were still available today in grey, blue and red, but in limited sizes.    Kate often turns to the Spanish boutique designer  company  for pieces for her children.   George's double-breasted wool coat features velvet detail on the buttons, collar and side pockets.   His warm coat was accompanied by his trademark look of socks pulled high, while Charlotte teamed festive red tights with a navy coat, and wore her hair tucked behind her ears.   Kate kept warm in a festive-coloured stole and coat which looked similar to one she wore in 2013 that was a hit with royal fashion watchers.   The Hobbs Unlimited Celeste wool coat has a belt at the waist and belted detail at the wrists.   In 2013, royal officials said the coat was burgundy in colour, but the fashion community favoured chestnut brown.   Meanwhile at Sandringham, Princess Eugenie wore a red felt cocktail hat by Sarah Cant and a black clutch bag by London handbag designer Stacy Chan.   The Duchess of Cambridge looked stylish and suitable festive as she recycled her maroon Hobbs coat previously worn in March 2013.   It came as a surprise to many that, in this special year the Queen reached her magnificent 90-year milestone and Prince Philip turned 95, two of their great-grandchildren Prince George, aged three, and Princess Charlotte, 18 months, will not be with them.    Royals including Prince Charles, The Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Harry, the Earl of Wessex and Prince Andrew made their way from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church to enjoy a private mass at 9am, before a second service at 11am today.   However the Queen herself was notably absent as she continues to recover from a heavy cold.   As supreme Governor of the Church of England, the Queen's faith is incredibly important to her - and this is the first time in nearly 30 years the 90-year-old Monarch has missed the service, which she and her husband Prince Philip, 95, have attended every year since 1988.   This comes amid a tumultuous week for the royals, which has seen the Queen and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh struck down with illness and the tragic news her granddaughter Zara Tindall had lost her unborn baby.   It is thought Zara, 35, would have been about four-months pregnant, and the baby was expected to arrive in late Spring.   She and her husband Mike Tindall, 38, were said to have been 'thrilled' about the prospect of a baby brother or sister for their daughter Mia, nearly three.   It is understood the royal had a miscarriage but it is not known when.   A spokeswoman for the couple said: 'Very sadly, Zara and Mike Tindall have lost their baby. At this difficult time, we ask that everyone respects their privacy.'   The spokeswoman would not give any details about the circumstances surrounding the loss of the couple's baby but it is understood Zara is not in any medical danger.   Pippa Middleton, the  Duchess of Cambridge 's sister, will be a spring bride as she walks down the aisle at her family church in May next year.   According to friends, the ceremony will take place on Saturday May 20 at St Marks' Church in Englefield, Berkshire, with the reception taking place back at the Middleton family home in Bucklebury a few miles away.   Prince George,  Pippa's nephew, is tipped to be a page boy and her niece Princess Charlotte, who will have just turned two, a flower girl.   The Duchess of Cambridge's little sister shot to public attention when she wore a bottom-hugging bridesmaid's dress at the royal wedding in 2011.   But she is said to have wanted a smaller, more intimate 'family' wedding when she weds wealthy hedge fund trader James Matthews next year.   The couple are believed to be setting a marquee up in the garden of Michael and Carole Middleton's mansion with upmarket Portaloos brought in for the occasion.   Trendy designer Giles Deacon is rumoured to be making Pippa's dress after he was spotted carrying garment bags into the \u00a317 million house with his and hers bathrooms she and James share in London.   Chelsea florist Lavender Green is arranging the flowers \u2013 likely to include spring blooms like daffodils.    Here is the Queen's Christmas message in full:   'There was a time when British Olympic medal winners became household names because there were so few of them. But the 67 medals at this year's Games in Rio and 147 at the Paralympics meant that the GB medallists' reception at Buckingham Palace was a crowded and happy event.   'Throughout the Commonwealth there were equally joyful celebrations. Grenada, the Bahamas, Jamaica and New Zealand won more medals per head of population than any other countries.   'Many of this year's winners spoke of being inspired by athletes of previous generations. Inspiration fed their aspiration; and having discovered abilities they scarcely knew they had, these athletes are now inspiring others.   'A few months ago, I saw inspiration of a different kind when I opened the new Cambridge base of the East Anglian Air Ambulance, where Prince William works as a helicopter pilot. It was not hard to be moved by the dedication of the highly skilled doctors, paramedics and crew, who are called out on average five times a day.   'But to be inspirational you don't have to save lives or win medals. I often draw strength from meeting ordinary people doing extraordinary things: volunteers, carers, community organisers and good neighbours; unsung heroes whose quiet dedication makes them special.   'They are an inspiration to those who know them, and their lives frequently embody a truth expressed by Mother Teresa, from this year Saint Teresa of Calcutta. She once said: 'Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love'.   'This has been the experience of two remarkable organisations, The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and The Prince's Trust, which are 60 and 40 years old this year. These started as small initiatives but have grown beyond any expectations, and continue to transform young people's lives.   'To mark my 90th birthday, volunteers and supporters of the six hundred charities of which I have been patron came to a lunch in The Mall. Many of these organisations are modest in size but inspire me with the work they do.   'From giving friendship and support to our veterans, the elderly or the bereaved; to championing music and dance; providing animal welfare; or protecting our fields and forests, their selfless devotion and generosity of spirit is an example to us all.   'When people face a challenge they sometimes talk about taking a deep breath to find courage or strength. In fact, the word 'inspire' literally means 'to breathe in'.   'But even with the inspiration of others, it's understandable that we sometimes think the world's problems are so big that we can do little to help. On our own, we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice, but the cumulative impact of thousands of small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine.   'At Christmas, our attention is drawn to the birth of a baby some two thousand years ago. It was the humblest of beginnings, and his parents, Joseph and Mary, did not think they were important.   'Jesus Christ lived obscurely for most of his life, and never travelled far. He was maligned and rejected by many, though he had done no wrong.   'And yet, billions of people now follow his teaching and find in him the guiding light for their lives. I am one of them because Christ's example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe.   'The message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received, and that love begins small but always grows.   'I wish you all a very happy Christmas.'",

Mrs May, 60, arrived at 1pm with her husband Philip, and chatted to guests sat at long tables before they ate their meals.   She looked smart in a \u00a3600 purple Escada pencil dress that she has already recycled for several high profile occassions, such as on the day she was would become Prime Minister and her first keynote speech at the Conservative Party Conference.   She said: 'It is great to be here at this event again this year.   'It is simply a fantastic event. It is very important.   'They can come together to have a good time, and probably sing a song or two at some point.'       Christmas films played on a projector in the hall before Mrs May arrived, and she gave a short speech thanking volunteers and wishing everyone in the room a merry Christmas.   Guests were then served their traditional meal, accompanied by live music.    Despite the name, the lunch is available to people of all faiths - provided they are at risk of loneliness on Christmas.   For some of the guests, their loved ones have passed away. For others, they are not able to get to their family, who could be living hundreds of miles away.   Many are known to the volunteers, having attended for several years.   Helen Wilson, who lives in the town, is a volunteer of 10 years but this was the first time the 94-year-old had attended as a guest.   Her husband passed away about 20 years ago, and she enjoyed coming along to have 'a natter'.   She added: 'Life gets very dreary. Nobody should be alone at Christmas.'    Earlier in the day, she turned to God on her first Christmas morning as Prime Minister after outlining her hopes of healing the Brexit divide in 2017.   The Prime Minister, a devout Christian who was brought up in a Vicarage  and husband Philip were seen arriving at St Andrew's Church in Sonning, Berkshire, situated within her Maidenhead constituency.    The pair had a security guard following them in tow, who was carrying what appeared to be a taser tucked under his jacket.   Mrs May is still a regular attendee at the the St Andrews, and attempts to go to services whenever her premiership does not get in the way.   It comes after she outlined that re-uniting the country following the bitter Brexit fallout is at the top of her Christmas wishlist.   In her first festive address as Prime Minister, she vowed to unite the country after a year of divisions over the European Union and forge a 'bold new role' for the UK in the world.     She said: 'Coming together is also important for us as a country.       'As we leave the European Union we must seize a historic opportunity to forge a bold new role for ourselves in the world and to unite our country as we move forward into the future.   'And, with our international partners, we must work together to promote trade, increase prosperity and face the challenges to peace and security around the world.'",

'The weirdest part was that no one else seemed shocked by the display apart from us, everyone was acting like it was totally normal which I didn't understand.'   Laura Ingate posted a video of the shop on snapchat, writing: 'Excuse me! I feel very uncomfortable about this shop window.'    It has been speculated that the store put up the raunchy display to catch customers' attention at a time when many are shopping online instead.   Retail analysts say millions of Britons will spend the  Christmas  break searching for bargains from Christmas Eve \u2013 predicting as much as \u00a39billion could be spent throughout the Christmas period until the new year.    Partly thanks to the rise of online shopping, Christmas Day itself has become a big day for shopping as people ditch party games and the  Queen 's speech to look for deals \u2013 and retailers expect record takings this year.   Web retail trade body IMRG predicts that spending online will rise by 10.1per cent to a new Christmas Day record of \u00a3805million.   The figure for Boxing Day is expected to soar by 15 per cent to a new high of \u00a3984million.",

Tori Gabriel's heart sank when her toddler daughter Jessica asked for a Thomas the Tank Engine dress for Christmas.

The 33-year-old mother decided to buy her little girl a pair of boys' Thomas pyjamas and posted a rant on Facebook about gender stereotypes.   On the  'Let Toys Be Toys' group, Tori said: 'I hate the fact that my Thomas the Tank Engine-obsessed daughter wants a Thomas DRESS for Christmas and I know I haven't got a hope.   'I already buy all her Thomas stuff from the boys' section.'   A month later, she came home to a missed delivery note and when she went to pick up the parcel there was a Thomas the Tank Engine dress inside.   Tucked next to it was a Christmas card and a Thomas toy sent by Emma Morgan from Melbourne, Australia - whose little boy also loves the classic talking train.   She had spotted Tori's post in a parenting group and, a keen sewer, decided to make the dress and send some Christmas cheer 10,462 miles across the globe.   After turning detective, Emma had found the mum's parenting blog, which fortunately had her address on for PR requests, and popped the special parcel in the post.   Bookshop worker Tori, of Ramsgate, Kent, said the toddler is delighted with her new dress.   The mum-of-two said: 'She loves Thomas the Tank Engine so much. She has everything there is - the bedding, slippers, toys, pyjamas, lights, a table, chair, DVDs.   'I was hoping I would find a dress somewhere but I couldn't, so I posted a rant online about two months ago.   'Then a couple of days ago I got home from work and had missed a package.   'We picked it up and when I opened it there was this dress inside. We were in the car and I showed it to Jessica.   'She said, \"Is it a Thomas dress? Is it mine, is it for me?\"   'I was absolutely stunned. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was such a sweet thing for a complete stranger to do.'   She added: 'Jessica loves it. She only asked for two things - the Thomas dress and a bottle of Cillit Bang toilet cleaner.   'She is not getting the Cillit Bang, but this has definitely made her Christmas.'   Tori took to Facebook again in a bid to track Emma down and after the post was spread around all the same parenting groups, she eventually got lucky.   Amazingly, Emma's dentist spotted the post and asked if she was the kind stranger.   Tori added: 'She sent me a message and I was able to thank her profusely for doing such a sweet thing.   'She didn't want any recompense.   'I just think it's incredible of her. There are so many horrible stories and I just think it's amazing that she would do that.'   Business manager Emma, 37, said that when she saw Tori's original post she simply had to help.   She said: 'I could tell that she was resigned to the fact that it would be nearly impossible to find one, so I wanted to make it happen.   'I didn't know where to send it or even how big to make it, but I knew I had to go buy some fabric and a pattern, and see what I could come up with.'   She added: 'It's not a magic fix for the overarching issue of gendered toys and clothes, but I hoped it would make a three-year-old happy and send a bit of kindness out into the world at Christmas.   'After Tori tracked me down, she told me that Jessica was thrilled with the dress, which was so lovely.'",

Now she has posted two pictures on Twitter of the couple ready for a black tie Christmas bash.   'I hope you all have an incredible #Xmas & may all your dreams come true for 2017. Our family Xmas has now started,' she tweeted.   Tim Eve wrote: 'What an amazing couple. Wishing you both the best for Christmas,' while Richard Tulk cheekily asked: 'new business partner?'   Glasgow-born Lady Mone was romantically linked to Mr Barrowman, 51, earlier this month after the pair were spotted strolling arm-in-arm.   She later tweeted 'After 25 years I've finally met my match' and added a red love heart emoji.   Mr Barrowman, from Rutherglen near Glasgow, made his fortune in private equity and property development, and lives in a multi-million pound home on the Isle of Man.   He recently featured in the Channel 4 documentary Million Pound Mega Yachts with one of his two superyachts, the 183ft Turquoise, which cost \u00a350m and has a staff of 13.   His fleet of luxury cars includes five Ferraris.   Lady Mone, who made her name with the Ultimo underwear brand, split from her husband Michael, with whom she has three children, in 2011 after 19 years of marriage.   Former prime minister David Cameron made her a peer in October 2015 and appointed her an adviser to the Government on business start-ups in disadvantaged communities.   Since entering the House of Lords as Lady Mone of Mayfair she has made one speech, in March this year.   Earlier this year Lady Mone cloaked her business empire in secrecy, by ending the requirement collection of her two companies to file public accounts.   It was reported in October that Lady Mone had split from another boyfriend, Barbados-based golf professional Stefan Soroka.   In August, it emerged she had taken full ownership of her former marital home in Thorntonhall, South Lanarkshire, which she had purchased with her former husband for more than \u00a31.5m in 2008.    It had been on the market for offers over \u00a31.6m since 2012.",

Reflecting on the months that followed his big win, he said: 'To be honest I've been doing all right. I've had a few football accumulators come in. Not massive wins ... a few hundred pounds.'   He added: 'I went Christmas shopping and we spent quite a bit on Christmas shopping for everyone, and we came back in time for the football. I put the accumulator on and it won - it paid for all the shopping that we did.'   Asked if he thinks he could make a career out of betting, he joked: 'I have considered it but I don't think I could,' adding: 'The thing is, I've not gone crazy with it, I've not been making stupid bets.   'I have been playing it, and I don't always win, but sometimes I do. But I think I win more than people I know, but I've been really, really lucky, to be honest.'   Mr Herbert said he has spent all his winnings and enjoyed the thousands by paying off his credit cards, buying a car, and going on a camping trip to Cornwall.   'I definitely had a good time spending it. The way I see it - I didn't have it before and it was a win so I enjoyed it,' he said, adding: 'It's just nice not to have to worry about anything, and you can do what you want, and go where you want, and not worry about money.'   A Leicester fan for more than 25 years, Mr Herbert said he never lost faith in his team throughout the season before they made history.   William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly said: 'Put into perspective, Leicester's Premier League victory was longer odds than Nessie being found, Elvis being alive or little green men coming down from Mars and settling on Earth.   '5000/1 are the biggest odds we have ever paid out on a single bet and almost certainly will ever pay out.'   Mr Herbert has placed a \u00a310 bet at 100/1 on Leicester winning the Champions League.",

Prince Charles , The Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Edinburgh,  Prince Harry , the Earl of Wessex and Prince Andrew joined other royals as they made their way from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church where they enjoyed two Christmas services.     As supreme Governor of the Church of England, the Queen's faith is incredibly important to her - and this is the first time in nearly 30 years the 90-year-old Monarch has missed the service, which she and her husband Prince Philip, 95, have attended every year since 1988.   It is thought the Queen has not missed a Christmas Day service at either Sandringham or Windsor Castle - the previous location for the monarch's festive break - in living memory.    This comes amid a tumultuous week for the royals, which has seen the Queen and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh struck down with illness and the tragic news her granddaughter Zara Tindall had lost her unborn baby.   It is thought Zara, 35, would have been about four-months pregnant, and the baby was expected to arrive in late Spring.   She and her husband Mike Tindall, 38, were said to have been 'thrilled' about the prospect of a baby brother or sister for their daughter Mia, nearly three.   It is understood the royal had a miscarriage but it is not known when.   A spokeswoman for the couple said: 'Very sadly, Zara and Mike Tindall have lost their baby. At this difficult time, we ask that everyone respects their privacy.'   The spokeswoman would not give any details about the circumstances surrounding the loss of the couple's baby but it is understood Zara is not in any medical danger.   The service at Sandringham is one of the highlights in the Royal calendar, in which members of the family spend quality time with one another.    However this is the first time in some 28 years the Queen has not attended.    A spokesman for Kensington Palace said today: 'Her Majesty The Queen will not attend Church at Sandringham this morning.    'The Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery.    'Her Majesty will participate in the Royal Family Christmas celebrations during the day.'    There was an outpouring of grief yesterday following news the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and her 38-year-old husband lost their unborn baby, just weeks after revealing they were expecting their second child.    The pair had been expected to spend Christmas at Sandringham but were not seen today.    And in a break from tradition, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have this year chosen to spend the holidays with Kate's parents, Michael and Carol Middleton, at their home in the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire, some 170 miles away.    It came as a surprise to many that, in this special year the Queen reached her magnificent 90-year milestone and Prince Philip turned 95, two of their great-grandchildren Prince George, aged three, and Princess Charlotte, 18 months, will not be with them.   Prince Harry, meanwhile, is at the estate alone as his girlfriend, American actress Meghan Markle, 35, spends the festive season with her family in Toronto.    Although Miss Markle was not invited the Queen is said to be 'fully supportive' of her grandson's relationship with the actress.   Senior members of the family have joined the Queen at Sandringham and they will all be sitting down promptly at 1.15pm in the green-walled dining room hung with Spanish tapestries and rising after just over an hour to be in good time to watch her annual message on TV to the Commonwealth at 3pm.    In her Christmas speech broadcast later on today, t he Queen will praise the 'inspirational' Team GB athletes in her Christmas Day address, as well as the achievements of 'ordinary people doing extraordinary things'.       In her annual televised message to the nation, the monarch will speak on the theme of 'inspiration', citing the work of 'unsung heroes' across the nation.   The broadcast comes at the end of a momentous year in which the UK voted for Brexit, leading to David Cameron resigning, and the Queen celebrated her 90th birthday.   The Queen, wearing a blue dress by Angela Kelly, will also refer to the achievements of the  Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which celebrated its 60th anniversary, and The Prince's Trust, which turned 40 this year.     Earlier in the week, royal aides were forced to cancel plans for the Queen and her husband to travel to Sandringham by train at the last minute after doctors deemed them too unwell to go.     Just over 24 hours later on Thursday and in a very unusual move, the royal couple took off from Buckingham Palace by helicopter.    The Queen never normally travels to Sandringham by helicopter, preferring to go by train or car, and her helicopter is only usually used to carry members of the Royal family on public engagements.    On Tuesday the Queen hosted her annual pre-Christmas lunch - a royal tradition which allows her to catch up with more distant relations who are not invited to join her at Sandringham on the 25th.   And it was also revealed earlier this week that the Monarch had relinquished more than two dozen of her most high profile patronages as she took another step back from royal duties.   Zara Tindall along with her husband Mike and daughter Mia, were thought to have been planning to spend Christmas Day   at the Queen\u2019s country house in Norfolk.   However they were not seen with other members of the Royal Family today.   Speaking to Country Life magazine in November, Zara spoke about how she was looking forward to spending Christmas with her family.   She said: 'Having all the generations of my family together at Christmas is my favourite part of the season.   'Christmas takes on a new magic when you have children'.    She continued: 'Mia will share this Christmas with lots of her cousins , some very close in age to her, and I think this year will be the one when she really starts to understand it all.'     The Queen's absence from the annual Christmas Day church service at Sandringham is one of the rare occasions she has missed an engagement.   She has been a steadfast presence during her reign, but there have been a small number of incidences when ill health has caused her to withdraw from her royal duties.   An official trip to Rome was cancelled in 2013 when the Queen was treated for the symptoms of gastroenteritis and stayed overnight in a private hospital.   In 2011 she had to miss a service of the Royal Victorian Order at Windsor Castle after suffering a nosebleed.   That was thought to be the first time she had missed a key public engagement in five years.   In 2006 she cancelled engagements after straining a back muscle and had official appointments scaled down after she underwent knee surgery in 2003.   Earlier this year an undisclosed minor ailment forced the Duke of Edinburgh to miss commemorations marking the anniversary of the First World War Battle of Jutland in Orkney, but he was present at the church service in Sandringham on Sunday.   He missed the Christmas service in 2011, after being admitted to hospital for a heart operation.      As they attended the Christmas service this morning, the Duchess of Cambridge and her children wrapped up warm in their festive coordinating outfits.    The Duchess of Cambridge dressed Prince George in a \u00a3120 Pepa & Co wool coat. Similar garments were still available today in grey, blue and red, but in limited sizes.    Kate often turns to the Spanish boutique designer  company  for pieces for her children.   George's double-breasted wool coat features velvet detail on the buttons, collar and side pockets.   His warm coat was accompanied by his trademark look of socks pulled high, while Charlotte teamed festive red tights with a navy coat, and wore her hair tucked behind her ears.   Kate kept warm in a festive-coloured stole and coat which looked similar to one she wore in 2013 that was a hit with royal fashion watchers.   The Hobbs Unlimited Celeste wool coat has a belt at the waist and belted detail at the wrists.   In 2013, royal officials said the coat was burgundy in colour, but the fashion community favoured chestnut brown.   Meanwhile at Sandringham, Princess Eugenie wore a red felt cocktail hat by Sarah Cant and a black clutch bag by London handbag designer Stacy Chan.    This is the second time William and Kate have spent time with the Middleton family over Christmas.    In 2012, Kate was suffering with severe morning sickness while pregnant with Prince George so stayed with her parents.    In another unusual move for the family, Kate and William chose to take their children along to church this morning - a move they would not usually make at Sandringham.    Prince George and Princess Charlotte attended their first Christmas communion service at the 12th century St Mark's Church in Englefield near the Middleton family home.   The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children were joined by newly-engaged Pippa Middleton and James Matthews for the service where the pair recently announced they will marry next year.    Bells rang as the Royals arrived outside the church where some 100 smiling locals were seen entering for its 10.30am Sunday service.   Prince George walked along holding his father's hand while and Princess Charlotte was carried in her mother's arms.   Prince William could be seen talking animatedly to his son as they strolled through the church yard, as the youngster wrapped up warm against the cold wind in a smart grey woollen coat.    The Duchess of Cambridge looked stylish and suitable festive as she recycled her maroon Hobbs coat previously worn in March 2013.    Here is the Queen's Christmas message in full:   'There was a time when British Olympic medal winners became household names because there were so few of them. But the 67 medals at this year's Games in Rio and 147 at the Paralympics meant that the GB medallists' reception at Buckingham Palace was a crowded and happy event.   'Throughout the Commonwealth there were equally joyful celebrations. Grenada, the Bahamas, Jamaica and New Zealand won more medals per head of population than any other countries.   'Many of this year's winners spoke of being inspired by athletes of previous generations. Inspiration fed their aspiration; and having discovered abilities they scarcely knew they had, these athletes are now inspiring others.   'A few months ago, I saw inspiration of a different kind when I opened the new Cambridge base of the East Anglian Air Ambulance, where Prince William works as a helicopter pilot. It was not hard to be moved by the dedication of the highly skilled doctors, paramedics and crew, who are called out on average five times a day.   'But to be inspirational you don't have to save lives or win medals. I often draw strength from meeting ordinary people doing extraordinary things: volunteers, carers, community organisers and good neighbours; unsung heroes whose quiet dedication makes them special.   'They are an inspiration to those who know them, and their lives frequently embody a truth expressed by Mother Teresa, from this year Saint Teresa of Calcutta. She once said: 'Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love'.   'This has been the experience of two remarkable organisations, The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and The Prince's Trust, which are 60 and 40 years old this year. These started as small initiatives but have grown beyond any expectations, and continue to transform young people's lives.   'To mark my 90th birthday, volunteers and supporters of the six hundred charities of which I have been patron came to a lunch in The Mall. Many of these organisations are modest in size but inspire me with the work they do.   'From giving friendship and support to our veterans, the elderly or the bereaved; to championing music and dance; providing animal welfare; or protecting our fields and forests, their selfless devotion and generosity of spirit is an example to us all.   'When people face a challenge they sometimes talk about taking a deep breath to find courage or strength. In fact, the word 'inspire' literally means 'to breathe in'.   'But even with the inspiration of others, it's understandable that we sometimes think the world's problems are so big that we can do little to help. On our own, we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice, but the cumulative impact of thousands of small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine.   'At Christmas, our attention is drawn to the birth of a baby some two thousand years ago. It was the humblest of beginnings, and his parents, Joseph and Mary, did not think they were important.   'Jesus Christ lived obscurely for most of his life, and never travelled far. He was maligned and rejected by many, though he had done no wrong.   'And yet, billions of people now follow his teaching and find in him the guiding light for their lives. I am one of them because Christ's example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe.   'The message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received, and that love begins small but always grows.   'I wish you all a very happy Christmas.'     Pippa Middleton today attended a Christmas service at the church where she will next year marry her multi-millionaire fiance.    The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister and fiance James Matthews joined Kate and William, her parents Michael and Carole Middleton, her brother James and niece and nephew, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.    They attended the service at St Mark\u2019s Church in Englefield, near the Middleton's \u00a34.7million mansion in Berkshire.   Ahead of Pippa's impending nuptials, the Cambridges are spending Christmas with Kate's family at the Middleton home near Bucklebury instead of joining other royals  at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.      Friends said the Middleton family are pulling out all the stops to mark the occasion as it will be Pippa\u2019s last Christmas as a single woman.   She will marry financier James Matthews on May 20 and the couple hope to start their own family soon afterwards.   Prince George,  Pippa's nephew, is tipped to be a page boy and her niece Princess Charlotte, who will have just turned two, a flower girl.   The Duchess of Cambridge's little sister shot to public attention when she wore a bottom-hugging bridesmaid's dress at the royal wedding in 2011.   But she is said to have wanted a smaller, more intimate 'family' wedding when she weds wealthy hedge fund trader James Matthews next year.   The couple are believed to be setting a marquee up in the garden of Michael and Carole Middleton's mansion with upmarket Portaloos brought in for the occasion.   Trendy designer Giles Deacon is rumoured to be making Pippa's dress after he was spotted carrying garment bags into the \u00a317 million house with his and hers bathrooms she and James share in London.   Chelsea florist Lavender Green is arranging the flowers \u2013 likely to include spring blooms like daffodils.   Kate\u2019s sister Pippa has previously written about \u2018magical\u2019 family Christmases and how their father dons fancy dress costumes including, once, that of an inflatable sumo wrestler.    Kate, 34, is very close to her family and has always made clear that they will play a significant role both in her life and those of her children.    This will be the second time Kate and William have joined the Middletons for Christmas Day since they married in 2011 and the first since their children were born.   The last time the couple stayed away from the traditional royal gathering was in December 2012, shortly after Kate was discharged from hospital having been treated for severe morning sickness when she was pregnant with George.   In 2014, William and Kate were believed to have lunched with the Middletons before attending the Christmas Day church service with the royals.   The Middleton mansion has always been a haven for William and Kate, and they spent a number of weeks there within days of George, now three, being born.",

He fought off competition from more than 1,000 entries to be named as the winner, scooping a grand prize worth \u00a32,500.   WINNER    Michael said: 'The moment came quite naturally, as anyone who has pets can attest to photos involving dogs are hard to arrange artificially!    'With the sun streaming in and my parents sat together on their anniversary in their garden \u2013 which is their pride and joy and they built side by side \u2013 it's a great symbol of romance standing the test of time.   'It's amazing to hear that my photo was chosen as the 2016 Love Captured competition winner \u2013 it's a moment I'm very glad to have captured.'   The company asked the nation to submit photographs  demonstrating what 'love' means to them.   eHarmony UK Country Manager Romain Bertrand said: 'As this year's competition closes, we're thrilled to have seen so many fantastic and imaginative entries.    'At eHarmony we're experts at connecting the right people to create happy relationships built to last.    'We also know that love comes in many forms. It's truly inspiring to see such a wide range of photos that demonstrate the different ways people see love across the UK.'      2ND PLACE   Title:  Love comes in all shapes and sizes   Photographer:  Sue Gibson, from Warwick    A moment between photographer Sue's father and her son, where they share a look and despite the age difference, a sense of symmetry exists between the pair.   Sue said: 'I'm utterly delighted to have one of my photos recognised by the judges of this national competition. My photo captured a snap of grandfather and grandson sharing a moment, as they often do, despite grandfather's disability.'     3RD PLACE   Title:  Wild Carneddau Ponies   Photographer:  Sandra Robinson, from Wales   With a wild Snowdonia landscape as the background, the photograph captures two wild ponies that seem to be nuzzling together, reminding us that love and affection isn't an exclusively human quality.   Sandra said: 'I spend many hours with these beautiful wild ponies of North Wales. They are Carneddau Ponies that roam over thousands of acres, mostly mountainous regions.    'I had been following this mare for a few months before her foal was born so to me this was a special moment. It's so lovely to have recognition for these beautiful ponies.'    4TH PLACE   Title:  Capturing our granddaughter Hannah   Photographer:  Gillian, in Northumberland   The wet sand reflects a cloudy sky, creating a seemingly infinite landscape while the photographer captures her granddaughter running along the beach, leaving footprints as she goes.   Gillian said: 'The family and I had been to Banborough in Northumberland for the weekend and went for a stroll along the beach just before evening set in.    'My granddaughter, Hannah, was dancing and running along the beach \u2013 she looked so happy and free, which inspired me to capture this moment.'       5TH PLACE   Title:  Sisters for life   Photographer:  Laura Davies, from Wales   A girl embraces her baby sister in a tender moment between two young people who will share a love for the rest of their lives, bonded by their sisterhood.   Laura said: 'I can't believe that my picture has been selected from over 1,000! I'm absolutely thrilled and so excited.   'We've had so many wonderful moments this year with weddings, babies and fun times and I'm over the moon that my one of my special moments has been included in eHarmony's Love Captured 2016.         6TH PLACE   Title:  Dinner in the romantic Maldives   Photographer:  Gareth Beynon, from the south West   The darkness of a calm sea at night is lit up by candlelight as a married couple enjoy dinner in the tropical paradise of the Maldives, staring only at one another despite the dramatic surroundings.   Gareth said: 'I'm honoured my photo was shortlisted. I love capturing beautiful moments and it's great to know that other people feel a connection with my work.   'On the last night of a romantic Maldives holiday I surprised my partner with a private dinner out over the ocean. I set up a tripod and took the photo as a long exposure while we had lobster and champagne in a perfect location.       7TH PLACE   Title:  Husband and Son   Photographer:  Jane McColl, from Yorkshire   Background: In this black and white photograph, a father and his young son look lovingly at one another, both laughing as they do, the love and joy clear from their faces.   Jane said: 'This is one I took in the summer when my son was 18 months old. I took a series of them lying on this blanket and they were giggling and pulling faces \u2013 it was this series of pictures that really made me see the bond between father and son and how many mannerisms and looks they shared.    'This is my favourite picture of them together, with that mutual laughter and love in their eyes.'    8TH PLACE   Title:  Captured at a local show   Photographer:  Yvette Robertshaw, from Wales   A young man braves the rain at a village show, holding his dog. Their close relationship is touching to witness as they rest their heads on one another.   Yvette said: 'I have to say my initial reaction was shock! It's absolutely thrilling and I'm humbled that the judges have selected my image as one of the top 10.    'This is a very special image for me, which I will always treasure and one I felt really captured a unique love at its purest form.'   9TH PLACE   Title:  Brother and sister love   Photographer:  Caroline Cordery, from the West Midlands   Mariella and Barnaby, the photographer's young children, can be seen sitting under an umbrella together with sun shining through in the background.   Caroline said: 'It's satisfying to capture their loving moments on camera because \u2013 despite the inevitable fighting \u2013 the love between a brother and sister is solid and unlike some relationships in life, they'll have each other for the rest of their lives.    'I hope when people see my photo, they'll remember to appreciate their siblings!'        10TH PLACE   Title:  Safia & Umama   Photographer:  Ata Adnan   Two young cousins share a loving embrace conveying the innocence of childhood and importance of family.   Ata said: 'I'm completely overwhelmed with this announcement. It is so special since this particular photograph is very close to my heart.

The unseasonably warm weather will give way to snow and potentially blizzard conditions as gusts of up to 90mph hit on Boxing Day.   Festive travellers are being urged to check before setting off as the stormy weather is predicted to cause disruption.   After a lull following the fallout from Storm Barbara, warnings have been issued for high winds and snow.       Scroll down for video      The Met Office issued a yellow 'be aware' wind alert for Christmas Day for the Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland.   A gust of 85.5mph was recorded at Scalpay Bridge in the Outer Hebrides on Sunday while at Castlebay in Barra speeds reached 74.9mph, the Western Isles Council said.   Emma Salter from the Met Office said it had been an 'exceptionally mild' Christmas, but warned of falling temperatures and difficult conditions on Boxing Day.   She said: 'Up in Scotland we have seen some quite strong gusts today already, 60mph winds, and some large waves too.   'That wind is due to strengthen tonight, and coupled with the snow it could be quite a difficult day tomorrow for people trying to get out and about, particularly the ferries and transport networks.   'There is the potential for blizzard conditions temporarily as well in that strong wind and snow.'     Swimmers from the Serpentine swimming club have started their Christmas Day with the traditional dip in the central London pool.   The Peter Pan Cup race is held every year on December 25.    The chilly waters didn't put off the King Edward's Bay swimmers in Newcastle either, who enjoyed a Christmas Day Dip against the backdrop of a fantastic sunrise.   Christmas Day was mild across the UK, with a high of 15C in Hull and 14.7C in Exeter but temperatures will fall to lows of 6C in parts of northern England, closer to the December average, the forecaster added.   Snow affected several routes in the north east of Scotland while restrictions were put in place on many bridges due to the windy conditions and the Dornoch Bridge was closed.   Alerts are also in place for the north west and north east of England, and Yorkshire and Humber where gusts of around 50-60mph are forecast.   On Boxing Day a more serious amber 'be prepared' warning has been issued for Orkney, Shetland and the most northerly part of the Highlands where winds could push 90mph.   Those areas were worst hit by Storm Barbara, which cut electricity to more than 25,000 homes.       Elsewhere, gales could hit parts of Grampian and Strathclyde, while snow alerts have been issued for central Scotland northwards as Storm Conor drags Arctic air across the region as it passes to the north of the country.   Snow accumulations of 5cm to 10cm are expected above about 200 metres, and 10cm to 15cm above about 400 metres, with drivers warned to be aware of icy patches.   Flood alerts are in place covering Tayside, Caithness and Sutherland, Orkney, Scottish Borders, Shetland, Skye, Easter Ross and Great Glen and Lochaber and the Western Isles, while local flood warnings have been issued for Tayside and Caithness and Sutherland.   Scotland's Transport Minister Humza Yousaf chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government's resilience team on Sunday with representatives of the Met Office, Transport Scotland, Police Scotland and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa).   He said: 'Our responders in the north have scarcely had a chance to recover from these conditions but now Storm Conor is set to bring the next test during Boxing Day.   'Of course many people will be travelling to meet loved ones and spend time with their families at this time of year and we would remind the public to check before they travel and delay their journey if they have to. Safety must be paramount and should take priority.'     Blades off a wind turbine were sent flying through the air as the gale force winds of Storm Barbara blew them off their hinges.   Ray Gansler, 50, was walking with his Staffordshire Bull Terrier Lucy in Bacup, Lancashire, and the blades flew  towards him.    The father-of-five said: 'I heard a noise that sounded like the squeak of a van and then I saw the blades of the turbine had come off and were coming towards me very quickly.   'I just hit the ground and covered Lucy. To me it seemed like it was coming close to me and then the wind caught it and smashed it into a field.'   One of the four 34.2m high wind turbines on land at Scar End Farm is now missing its three blades and central hub; they landed in a nearby field full of saplings.   Mr Gansler, of Weir near Bacup, said: 'As the blades dug into the ground it didn't half make a loud noise. It frightened my dog and it frightened me. It made such a loud bang and I didn't know if the blades were going to come off.'   He raised the alarm with the owner of the land where the turbines are based and also contacted the police.   Mr Gansler said: 'The turbine nearest the farm had switched off, but the other two were still spinning around at a rapid speed.   'I was worried that if another one broke off and landed on the other side of the hill there are houses nearby.   'When you see something like that coming towards you, you really think it is going to hit you.'   TGC Renewables applied for the wind farm at Scar End in 2012 and was initially rejected permission by Rossendale Borough Council following public objection. That decision was overturned later that year on appeal by the planning inspector.     'The Scottish Government's resilience team has been meeting throughout the past week to monitor the impact of the severe weather and will remain operational through Christmas Day, into Boxing Day, to make sure that the most reliable and relevant information is being communicated to people as early as possible.   'The worst of Storm Conor is once again expected to affect the north of Scotland, the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, bringing heavy rain and winds of up to 90mph.   'I can assure the travelling public that our transport operators and trunk road operating companies are working hard to keep services and roads running.   However, safety is always our top priority, so we are seeing likely to see disruption to ferries and possibly flights to the islands. It is important to remember that operators do not cancel services lightly.'               The forecast comes after Storm Barbara wreaked havoc across Britain's coastline yesterday.     The storm brought 117mph winds and torrential rain, and ripped the roofs off schools in North Wales, sweeping through Rhosgadfan, near Caernarfon on Friday afternoon, tearing off slates and leaving a huge hole in its wake.   In Blackpool, people fought the winds just to stay upright as the storm raged on.    One local man, who asked not to be named, said: 'The roof has come clean off. It was like if a hurricane had come through here. It's serious.'   Dafydd Williams, who lives near to the school, could not believe the strength of the wind blowing through the village.   He said: 'I was sitting in my conservatory and the wind came through. I thought my roof was coming off and all the pipes and everything were shaking. Two trees were uprooted and landed in a nearby field. Another two trees have also gone with the wind.   'I was really frightened. The whole house was shaking. I thought the conservatory was going to go.   'The school roof had only been renewed a few years ago. I've never seen anything like this before.'   No one was hurt in the incident.   Ysgol Rhosgadfan headteacher Paul Carr said: 'Thank God that there were no children in the school when it happened and that nobody has been hurt.'   Chairman of the governors Dylan Humphreys said: 'We're devastated. Until we know exactly the extent of the damage we can't say any more. We're just so glad that nobody was hurt.'        The Met Office said the strongest gusts of wind from Storm Barbara were recorded at Sella Ness, Shetland, which logged 83 mph, Islay, Argyll recording 79mph, Fair Isle, Shetland at 76 mph and Mona, Anglesey with 75 mph.   The strongest gust across exposed mountain sites was 117mph over Cairngorm in the Highlands.           Dean Hall, a Met Office forecaster, said: 'For Christmas Eve there is a north/south split across the UK. We still have very gusty, squally conditions across much of Scotland and the north of England and Northern Ireland with further showers, some heavy at times and turning wintry over higher ground.   'Through the day the next weather system is coming in which is the start of Storm Conor, that's going to bring more persistent rain in Northern Ireland, Western Scotland and North West England.   'That will herald the arrival of Storm Conor through Christmas Day but the main impact will not be realised until Boxing Day.'",

JK Rowling reached a low point in her life in the early 1990s, when she described herself as being 'poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless'.    That all changed when she wrote Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a book which led to six more in the series, plus a film franchise and numerous spin-offs.   She has remained a popular figure in British culture, although has caused controversy with political donations in recent years, including to the Better Together campaign in Scotland.",

   "5. summary": "As crowds gathered to pay tribute to James Brown a decade ago, few had any idea about how ugly the battle over his estate would prove.",

   "7. content": "The Godfather of Soul. Mr Dynamite. Soul Brother Number One. The Hardest Working Man In Showbusiness. The list of names that James Brown was known by goes on.   An icon whose influence stretched far beyond the music industry  he did so much to shape, he rubbed shoulders with Presidents, lobbied for civil rights and inspired millions the world over.   Right up until his death, he never lost his sense of drama, bowing out on Christmas day in 2006 after a career spanning more than half a century.   Scroll down for video    And yet since his death, his wish to leave the bulk of his estimated $100million fortune to provide scholarships for needy children has caused a huge legal fallout.   In a book published earlier this year, author James McBride lamented: 'Not a dime of it has reached a single kid.'   A state Supreme Court has even warned that the debacle could discourage others from leaving money to charity on their death, after his will was challenged by members of his family.   It was a situation that the soul music superstar sadly saw coming. Brown, who charted nearly 100 times on the Billboard chart, confided to a close friend that there would be a 'big mess' when he died.   He was right.    But as thousands of people lined the streets outside the Apollo Theater - the scene of some of Brown's finest musical triumphs - a decade ago, few had any idea about the chaos which was to follow.   When news of his death  broke, Michael Jackson described him as 'my greatest inspiration'.   Mick Jagger called him a 'one-of-a-kind, never to be repeated star', while an emotional Snoop Dogg said it was like losing a member of his family.   Even the incumbent President, George W Bush, expressed his sense of loss, describing Brown as 'an American original'.   Reflecting on her father's legacy, daughter Deanna Brown Thomas told MailOnline: 'He was a cultural icon. The messages in his music are still very relevant today, such as don't be a dropout, and \"Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.   'His music moves you physically and emotionally. Generations of people can feel his music. It moves the soul as well.'   Now president of the  James Brown Family Foundation , which helps support needy children during the festive period, she said her intention is to carry on her father's charitable work.   'He always believed in not forgetting from whence he came.    'He had very humble beginnings where he was sent home from school for insufficient clothing, they were filled with holes and were not clean,' Brown Thomas said.   'He never had a Christmas tree with toys flanked around it.    'So for him to create the opportunity for others to be blessed is just what he his nature called for... caring and sharing in his community.'      And Brown Thomas described charity work as 'the core of his spirit'.   It was this generosity of spirit that prompted the soul and funk music pioneer to leave the bulk of his fortune to provide scholarships for underprivileged children in his native North Carolina and in Georgia, where he spent most of his childhood.   But a decade after his death, this wish has yet to be fulfilled, and the money he left behind has dwindled.   In the introduction to his book Kill 'Em and Leave: Searching For The Real James Brown, published earlier this year, author James McBride wrote: 'Untold millions have been frittered away by lawyers and various factions of his destroyed family.'   Brown Thomas declined to comment on McBride's book, saying she had not read it.   Although he has been described by friends and associates as intensely private, the legal wranglings following Brown's death have been played out in the full glare of the public.   Back in 2000, when he made his will, the soul music icon left an audio tape explaining his intentions - and warned that anyone who challenged it would be disinherited, saying disputes would be an 'affront' to his wishes.   He left $2million in scholarships for his seven grandchildren, and left property worth another $2million to be shared among the six children he recognised.   This was not, however, the end of the matter.    A telling line in McBride's book is from Brown's long-term associate, Charles Bobbit.   Aware that his death would open a hornet's nest, Bobbit recalled that Brown had told him: 'It\u2019s gonna be a big mess when I die, Mr Bobbit. A big mess. Stay out of it.'   Bobbit told the author he has been pained by what had happened since.      The will was challenged by some of Brown's children, and by his partner, Tomi Rae Brown, who was eventually recognised as his widow.   Such was the legal mess that ensued that South Carolina's government seized control of his estates, redirecting half of his assets in 2008.   The intervention by state Attorney General Henry McMaster prompted an outcry after  more than half the cash bequeathed to charity was instead awarded to Brown's relatives.   But in 2013 McMaster's decision was overruled by the state's Supreme Court, which described it as an unprecedented overstepping of authority.   A  decision  published at the time stated: 'It appears Brown painstakingly developed his estate plan over the course of several years.'   He had also 'made it clear that he intended the bulk of his estate to be used for the education of disadvantaged youths, as he had provided for his family members during his lifetime'.   Further claimants, the ruling said 'were purposefully excluded', it said.   It added: 'Brown had a reputation as a strong-willed individual who did not take orders from others, and he made his desires abundantly clear during his lifetime.'   The result of the Attorney General's intervention, the ruling said, was 'to take a large portion of Brown's estate that Brown had designated for charity and to turn over these amounts to the family members and purported family members who were, under the plain terms of Brown's will, given either limited devises or excluded'.    Such an undermining of Brown's intention, it warned, would create a chilling effect on others who want to leave money to charity after their death.   'Were we to accept the new estate plan, we would undermine any confidence citizens may have in their ability to do with their personal assets as they wish, leading to a chilling effect on future testators in South Carolina wishing to make charitable testamentary devises,' the ruling read.    A decade after Brown's death, this remains unsettled.   A deal was struck earlier this year, in which four of Brown's six children, Larry, Yamma, Vanisha and Deanna, agreed to end their opposition to the will in exchange for one-sixth of the property.   But two, Daryl and Terry, are against this, and the case is now going through the South Carolina Court of Appeals.   Official documents reveal that the I Feel Good trust, set up to distribute Brown's wealth to children, had no assets and had carried out no charitable activity in 2015.    Papers filed to the IRS in February this year reveal that no money has been distributed by the James Brown 'I Feel Good' Trust for each of the years since 2010.   The document was signed by trustee Russell L. Bauknight.    Interest in Brown's legacy has spiked, with the 2014 release of biopic Get On Up, starring Chadwick Boseman as Brown.   And an HBO documentary, Mr Dynamite: The Rise of James Brown, was released the same year, produced by Mick Jagger.   The films chart the musician's rise to fame after an impoverished childhood, during which he was abandoned by his mother at an early age and living for years in his aunt's brothel.   He grew up in Augusta, Georgia, and by the time his career began to take off in the early 1950s, he had served time in a juvenile detention for robbery before securing an early release.   Yet his electric stage shows and massive catalogue of hits ensured he became one of the best-known musicians on the planet.   In death, as in life, Brown's story is anything but dull, but it remains to be seen whether his legacy plays out as he intended.",

From meddling mother-in-laws to screaming children, keeping everyone happy is half the battle of enjoying the festive period.   However, Lucy Davis and Isabelle Hung, a psychologist who specialises in relationships and founder of divorceclub.com, has shared her simple formula for dealing with every type of family member and eventuality this December.        The lazy relative   There is always one person who manages to shirk their share of the festive work. They might be quite blatant about it and simply park themselves in front of the TV while you clear the table, or they might find an excuse such as having to leave early.     If you know in advance who will be the lazy oaf, then tell them in advance how you would appreciate their help. If you find yourself having to do all the dishes, ask them to help and if they don't then calmly explain to others how it makes you feel when you have to do all the work and ask them how they can help keep harmony.       Keeping the in-laws happy   When you choose your partner, you do not choose the in-laws and likewise, they do not choose you. Common gripes and arguments are often a way of expressing an underlying big issue, which can't always be discussed or acknowledged.    It is safer to argue about someone putting their elbows on the table than say that you are sad that your son loves his wife more than his mother or that you feel threatened that you are no longer the head of a family anymore.    Another common phenomenon is that the traits that annoy you in a partner are often found in the in-laws and it is easier to be angry with them rather than acknowledge that they are there in your family. So the in-laws often have to bear the brunt of the anger of the partner.   Be compassionate with all members and remember that it takes time to love others and it is okay if you don't.    Inconsiderate gifts     Inconsiderate or stingy gifts are a common cause of noses being put out of joint on Christmas Day.   So much anticipation goes into the giving and receiving of gifts it can be a real let down when people get it wrong, with emotions running high.    It's worth remembering that receiving gifts with good grace is just as important as giving nice gifts, so if you are on the wrong end of a rubbish present, try to be grateful for the thought, however minimal!   Alcohol   Britons drink 41 percent more in December than the rest of the year, reaching a peak at Christmas. On Christmas Day drinking rules go out of the window, with many people happy to hit the Bucks Fizz shortly after breakfast. So by the time Christmas lunch arrives, some relatives are already three sheets to the wind.    It's very easy for fights to ensue when people are drunk, but getting people to moderate their drinking is a tall order. If you're hosting Christmas and you know you have a heavy drinker in the family, make sure you provide plenty of enticing soft drinks to alternate with the booze, and don't keep all the booze out on display where people can help themselves.    Over-excited kids   Christmas equals over-excited kids. Once the children realise Santa has been, there's no getting them back to sleep again. Unfortunately, that means an extremely tired household, so the day's off to a bad start before sunrise. As most parents know, tired kids can often mean hyperactivity kicks in, which can be stressful both for the parents and non-parents.    Tempting though it may be to try and give advice on how to reign in very boisterous children, this is also a common source of family feuds. If you are not the parent, try and bite your tongue, or ask if you can help.    If you are the parents of over-excited children and you can see they are getting to fever pitch, wrap them up and take them for a five minute walk around the block. A change of scene can help calm excited brains, work off some energy and give all the other adults in the house a break!      Sibling rivalry   A third of siblings who fought as kids continue to fight throughout adulthood. Rivalry for parents' affections, one-upmanship, and simply having different characteristics can all be flashpoints for arguments when together under one roof.    Unfortunately, the idea that habits of a lifetime will suddenly disappear because it's Christmas never quite plays out, so if you fight with your brothers and sisters the rest of the year, Christmas is unlikely to be any different.    If you are determined to have a good Christmas, try to remember in advance of the day what the thing most likely to wind you up will be and avoid talking about them, or steel yourself not to rise to comments that ordinarily would set off a fight. And limit the amount of time spent together. Perhaps leave after Christmas lunch before too much alcohol gets consumed and resolve to get along is weakened.",

   "6. description": "More than \u00a3100,000 of British taxpayers' money has been spent on a family court dispute centred on a seven-year-old boy who was born in Afghanistan and has never set foot in the UK, a judge has revealed. The boy's parents left him with an uncle in Afghanistan when he was a month old, judges in London have heard. They then travelled to England and subsequently separated.

She says her estranged husband, Sayed Hashimi, knows where he is and she has taken legal action.",
   "7. content": "More than \u00a3100,000 of British taxpayers' money has been spent on a family court dispute centred on a seven-year-old boy who was born in Afghanistan and has never set foot in the UK, a judge has revealed.   The boy's parents left him with an uncle in Afghanistan when he was a month old, judges in London have heard.   They then travelled to England and subsequently separated.   The boy's mother, Hadiah Hashimi, says she has not seen her son since she left Afghanistan and wants him brought to England.   She says her estranged husband, Sayed Hashimi, knows where he is and she has taken legal action.   Mr Justice Holman says both parents are getting legal aid.    The judge has told how the boy's mother has run up more than \u00a360,000 in lawyers' bills and his father more than \u00a340,000.   He has revealed figures in a written ruling on the latest round of litigation.   Mr Justice Holman says at some stage a judge will have to balance the overriding objective of the litigation against the cost.   Earlier this year another judge had concluded that Mr Hashimi knew where the boy was, and ordered him to provide information about the youngster's whereabouts.   Mrs Hashimi claimed that Mr Hashimi had not told the truth and had breached that order.    She asked Mr Justice Holman to rule that Mr Hashimi was in contempt of court and to jail him.   Mr Justice Holman dismissed her application.   The judge analysed the contempt allegations at a public hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.   He has named Mr and Mrs Hashimi in his ruling but has not said where they live.   'The fact is that within about a month of the birth of the child, the mother and the father did both travel to England leaving the child at that stage in the care of the uncle,' said Mr Justice Holman.   'It is the case of the mother that she understood that the child would follow fairly soon to England, once his capacity to enter the United Kingdom had been established.   'The mother has never seen that child again. For at least six years she has not had the slightest idea where her child is. She does not know whether he is still in Afghanistan and, quite frankly, in view of the strife within that country in recent years, she cannot even reliably know whether her child is still alive.'   He added: 'It is hard to imagine a greater suffering and torment than that which that mother must daily go through.'   But he said there had to be 'some limits' to the litigation, which the woman had launched nearly six years ago.   'Over \u00a3100,000 of public money has already been expended on litigation in relation to the whereabouts of this child, who has in fact never, ever set foot in the United Kingdom,' said Mr Justice Holman.   'At some point a judge will have to grapple with the overriding objective and considerations of cost and proportionality.'   Detail of the case emerged in May, in a ruling by another judge. Mr Justice Peter Jackson concluded that the father knew where the boy was, and ordered him to provide information about the youngster's whereabouts.   Lawyers representing the man said the 'investigation' into the boy's 'situation' was in the hands of Afghan authorities and they said a judge in England should not 'seek to take over'.   Mr Justice Jackson said the case was 'highly unusual' and described the order he made as unprecedented.   But he said the answer lay in England - because the father lived in England.",

The tree's steel-and-wire frame is covered with a plastic net decorated with more than 1 million natural pine cones painted red, gold, green and silver, 600,000 LED bulbs and topped by a 6-meter (20-foot)-tall shining star. \n The tree costs $80,000 and was criticized by the Catholic Church as a \"waste of money.\" The church suggested that the funds better be spent on helping the poor. \n \n More on this... \n \n \n \n \n Michelle Obama tracks Santa on Christmas Eve \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Philippines braces for Christmas storm, offers roasted pigs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pope celebrates Christmas Eve Mass after year of peace pleas \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hundreds of port workers and volunteers struggled for four months to put up the tree in time for the holidays. Work was suspended for six days in early December after Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith \u2014 representing the island nation's 1.5 million Catholics \u2014 lambasted the project. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to the criticism by saying the tree was not being built with public money, but with donations from individuals and private firms. \n The Guinness World Records is yet to confirm if this is the tallest artificial Christmas tree. Currently, the record is held by a Chinese firm that put up a 55-meter (180-foot) tree-like tower of lights and synthetic foliage, ornaments and lamps in the city of Guangzhou last year. \n Sri Lankan organizers said they wanted the tree to help promote ethnic and religious harmony in the Buddhist-majority island nation, where a long civil war ended in 2009 but reconciliation remains a challenge. \n \"This is just to show the world that we can live as one country, one nation,\" said Arjuna Ranatunga, a former cricket player and the minister of ports and shipping. He said Sri Lanka still is still grappling with issues regarding religion, caste and race. \n Minority Christian and Muslim communities complain of state-sponsored discrimination, and there are allegations of widespread abuses against minority ethnic Tamils both during and after the war.",

To outrage in Beijing, Trump later suggested he could reevaluate U.S. policy on Taiwan. \n China seized a U.S. Navy underwater glider in the South China Sea on Dec. 16 in what was seen by Chinese analysts as a warning to Trump. \n \n More on this... \n \n \n \n \n US intel: China to put missiles on S China Sea man-made islands to guard airstrips \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n GM's China partnership $29 million in anti-monopoly case \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n China 'closely following' Trump comments on nuclear policy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n China said last month that its aircraft carrier, purchased as an incomplete hull from Ukraine more than a decade ago, was ready to engage in combat. The Liaoning recently completed its first live-fire exercise along with fighters in the Bohai Sea in eastern China and, on Friday, the military announced it had carried out a series of fighter launch, recovery and air combat exercises slightly farther afield in the Yellow Sea. \n On Saturday morning, the Liaoning carried out training in the East China Sea, according to footage shown on state broadcaster China Central Television. A separate statement from the Defense Ministry said that several carrier-based fighter jets and helicopters took off one after another and returned after completing an air tactical confrontation and air refueling exercise. \n The Japanese Defense Ministry said it spotted the Liaoning as part of a fleet of eight Chinese warships that included destroyers and frigates, in the central part of the East China Sea for the first time. It said there was no incursion into Japanese waters. \n China hasn't described specifically how it intends to use the Liaoning, but it is seen as helping reinforce China's increasingly assertive claims over almost all of the South China Sea, which is home to key shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and a potential wealth of mineral resources. \n Five other governments claim the maritime space either in part or in whole, and the Philippines and Vietnam in particular have sought assistance from the U.S. and others in beefing up their ability to resist China, including its construction of seven islands by piling sand atop coral reefs.",

A grown up was acting overly excited as a joke and the cat walked across the room then back. He wasn't \"startled\".   'You can clearly see him walk up and calmly sit while planning his attack.

Scroll down for video    Although Secret Service sectioned off the entire block, tourists and local shopkeepers quickly got wind of President Obama's appearance in the neighborhood and flocked to both sides of the block hoping to catch a glimpse.   The president, wearing casual clothes and flip flops, shook hands and spoke with a small crowd outside the store.    Obama took off his sunglasses once someone in the crowd outside handed him a baby to hold, which he happily did.    He spent some time speaking to a few children in the crowd before he wished everyone a Merry Christmas. The crowd sent him off with a cheerful applause.     The trio's day started with lunch at the Side Street Inn, which is a popular eatery for both locals and tourists visiting Honolulu.    After they finished dining, Obama and his girls took a short drive over to Breakout Waikiki for some afternoon fun.   As the President's motorcade rode along Kalakaua Avenue to the venue, dozens of tourist flocked to the area with hopes of seeing the First Family.   The venue, described as 'Hawaii's first live-action escape room,' has breakout rooms which are realistic puzzle-based spaces where people are 'trapped' in a room and must work as a team to break out.    Breakout Waikiki challenged POTUS last year in a tweet to try his hand at the game.   ' Hey @POTUS, if you think running a country is hard, try breaking out of one of our rooms! #WambachDidIt #BringMichelle #ShesYourOnlyHope', the tweet sent December 23, 2015 reads.    It seems as though the president took the business up on its offer, as he showed unannounced with Malia and Sasha.    'To be totally honest, we didn't know that they were coming. It was 100 per cent unexpected. They booked under a different name,' MacGregor Greenlee, general manager, told  BuzzFeed News . 'An hour earlier, Secret Service showed up.'    He shared that the family successfully broke out of Mission Manoa, which is one of the most difficult rooms.    The trio spent about an hour and half inside of Breakout Waikiki, but they only had an hour to finish the game.    'They were yelling screaming having a blast. They broke out with 12 seconds left,' Greenlee said.      Shift leader Mitch Massey described Mission Manoa as a room where 'you're a secret agent and terrorists come and grab you.'   He added that 'Malia  did a lot of the work' and agreed that Mission Manoa is a difficult room to break out of.    Massey said that when he met the President, he told him that he was in Iraq when he voted for him to win the White House.    Greenlee shared that he wrote the tweet to Obama last year.       'I was sad that nothing came of it but this more than makes up for it,' the general manager shared.              Obama, who is known to exercise regularly, kicked Christmas Eve off with a morning workout at a gym near the family's vacation home on the island of Oahu.   While the the two siblings and their father enjoyed the day out in Hawaii, First Lady Michelle Obama spent the day telling kids across the country how much progress Santa has made in his gift-giving journey.   She volunteered to take calls through the NORAD Tracks Santa program, as it was her last time  carrying out her annual tradition.   The first lady spent roughly a half-hour talking with kids. In a transcript of the calls released by the White House, she told callers that Santa was flying over Malta, Sardinia and Hungary.   She also heard from children about the gifts they were hoping to get. Some of the highlights included a drone, a hoverboard and a hedgehog.   The President ended the day by making Christmas Eve calls to U.S. Troops stationed overseas.    The Obamas are spending their annual two-week winter vacation on the island of Oahu in Obama's home state.",

Scroll down for video     Tweets were then assigned into one of eight categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, shame or confusion.   The basic rule of the analysis was that the more a candidate was tweeted about with 'extreme emotion', the lower their final vote count would be on November 8.   They also looked at 'choppiness', which was when there were seemingly differing emotions on a candidate. It was better for a candidate to be steady.    Trump was much steadier than Clinton, the results found, with the Democratic nominee significantly 'choppier'.   'We did think: this can\u2019t be right,' Jackson told the  Huffington Post .    'People were saying \"you\u2019ve got it wrong, you\u2019ve got it wrong\". But we were saying - \"we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis before, this is what it\u2019s saying.\"'    Sykora told the website Trump incredibly managed to be a more calming figure on Twitter, despite being dogged by a number of sexual assault allegations and the infamous 'p***ygate' recording.   'In the three weeks ahead of November 8, our model was telling us Trump was ahead based on the measures we were using,' he said.   'There were maybe two or three instances where Hillary caught up and was slightly ahead, but the data was telling us he was dominating.'   Jackson went on to say he believes the method can help pollsters in future, as the traditional method of asking people who they plan to vote for becomes increasingly outdated.   'The world has changed. The pollsters ask \"who are you going to vote for?\" That\u2019s a snapshot in time,' he said.   'With this type of system - longitudinal, over a long period of time - you can\u2019t really lie.   'Your feelings might change, but it gives you a much more accurate picture of what\u2019s going on.'",

   "7. content": "Carrie Fisher will likely spend Christmas in the intensive care unit after she suffered a massive heart attack while on board an 11-hour transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles.   But the 60-year-old actress won't be alone. Her daughter, Billie Lourd, 24, was photographed along with her mother's beloved French bulldog Gary sitting outside the UCLA Medical Center on Friday afternoon.    The star's condition is still unknown as family and friends continue to wait for an update.   A harrowing distress call made by the flight's pilot revealed that Fisher was kept alive with CPR administered by a fellow passenger after she stopped breathing for about 10 minutes.     The star's brother, Todd Fisher, told  Variety  in a phone interview that there was 'no good or bad news' from doctors, with reports that Fisher is currently breathing through a ventilator.    Prior to landing at LAX, the pilot of the United Flight told the control tower that passengers aboard the plane were helping an 'unresponsive passenger,' but did not name who it was.   He revealed that that at least one of the passengers who rushed to the aid of Fisher - best known for her role as Princess Leia in the  Star Wars  franchise - was a nurse.   Scroll down for video    During the recording, an official from the control tower asked the pilot: 'United 935, I need the nature of your medical emergency, and also the sex of the patient and if there is medical personnel at the gate.'   'Yeah, we've coordinated medical personnel for the gate, we have some passengers, nurses, assisting the... unresponsive passenger,' the pilot replied.     'So they're working on her right now, we're going to have her seated in about two minutes and we should hopefully be on the deck in about five.'     She was in the process of traveling home for Christmas, having spent the last few weeks promoting her new memoir, called The Princess Diarist.   Lourd, who is also an actress who starred in Scream Queens and had a cameo alongside her mother in The Force Awakens - is Carrie's only child with talent agent Bryan Lourd.       Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott said paramedics were standing by for the plane's arrival at 12.11pm (PT) and immediately provided 'advanced life support, aggressively treated, and transported' the patient to UCLA Medical Center.    The  Los Angeles Times  reported that 'the actress was in a lot of distress on the flight'.    A statement released by United Airlines said that medical personnel met the aircraft on arrival after the crew reported that a passenger was unresponsive.    'Our thoughts are with our customer at this time,' the statement read.    Actress and well-known YouTube performer Anna Akana was seated in front of Fisher on the United flight. Akana said on Twitter that Fisher 'was not breathing for 10 minutes or so' and that CPR was administered on Fisher until the plane landed.   Akana wrote: 'Don't know how else to process this but Carrie Fisher stopped breathing on the flight home.   'Hope she's gonna be OK. So many thanks to the United flight crew who jumped into action, and the awesome doctor and nurse passengers who helped.'       Outside of her Beverly Hills home, Fisher's housekeeper, Mike Gonzalez, told DailyMail.com: 'We don't know how she is yet. We had a Christmas meal planned here. Who knows what will happen now.    'She didn't have problems with her heart - but it could happen to anyone, even kids can have heart attacks. I'm really shocked.    'She's really nice. I've worked with her for 15 years. When they said it was a heart attack this morning I was very worried.'    Fisher's mother, film legend Debbie Reynolds, 84, is awaiting news of her daughter's health from the home she owns next door to her.    Debbie was believed to be at her property in Beverly Hills  as reports of the dramatic health scare broke.   A male caretaker confirmed Debbie is aware of the sad news, but insisted it was too early for her to comment.   He said: 'We still don't know what's happened at the moment.'    The caretaker, who often looks after Debbie and her house, appeared in shock as he took a phone call on his cell phone and headed back inside the property.    In addition to Fisher's family  rushing to her bedside at  UCLA Medical Center, some of her close friends have also made their way to the hospital.   Close friend Patricia King, 69, told DailyMail.com that her husband Dennis, also 69, is currently with the Star Wars actress in the hospital and that there has been 'no change so far'.   'My husband is with her at the hospital now but there's been no change as far as I know,' said King.   'We just love her so much \u2013 we saw her last month and she was so much fun, laughing and lovely. The whole family is praying for her right now \u2013 we are really hoping that she's going to be ok.'   Asked about Fisher's trip to London, King added: 'Carrie wants to be English, she just bought a home over there. She just loves it there.'    Fisher is currently in the middle of a book tour for her memoir, The Princess Diarist, which is based on diaries Fisher kept while filming Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.   Fisher looked full of health and was busy shooting two new projects in the UK before her Friday heart attack.   She was working on the Graham Norton show as well as the TV series Catastrophe, and seemed to be enjoying England.    She discussed her latest book on The Graham Norton Show episode which aired on December 9.   On Twitter she documented her time in the country, with her most recent post on Wednesday at the Charles Dickens lounge.    The actress's representatives did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's requests for comment on Friday afternoon.     Fisher first played the iconic role of  Princess Leia when she was just 19 years old.   She is considered Hollywood royalty, as she is the daughter of famous couple Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher and was born in Beverly Hills.     The actress has both written and spoken about her struggles in Hollywood, including her mental health issues and the solution she found for treatment - radical-sounding electroshock therapy.   Fisher's most recent health problems come after the actress revealed that she dropped 35 lbs before playing Princess Leia in last year's Star Wars film, The Force Awakens.    She told Good Housekeeping that she was forced to drop the weight in order to reprise her iconic role in the movie.     'They don't want to hire all of me, only about three-quarters,' she said.    'Nothing changes, it's an appearance-driven thing. I'm in a business where the only thing that matters is weight and appearance.   'That is so messed up. They might as well say get younger, because that's how easy it is.'   Fisher told the magazine that she was able to lose the weight 'the same way everybody has to - don't eat and exercise more.'    During her appearance on The Graham Norton Show that aired on December 9, Fisher discussed her latest book, The Princess Diarist.   The 60-year-old actress shared that she forgot that she wrote the diaries decades ago when she was 19 years old and found them in a storage room.   Fisher said that she did not edit the diaries and what's in her book is truly how she felt while she had an affair with her Star Wars co-star Harrison Ford.   Norton said that the news of her affair with Ford has caused a 'sensation.'   '400,000 news services picked it up, it became a little embarrassing for me,' Fisher responded.   Norton then said he found it extraordinary how they had the affair roughly 40 years ago and how she claims they never spoke of it ever again.   'I became friends with his second wife then, so we saw each other a lot ... I can literally remember three times \u2026 I of course made some oblique reference to it, and he went 'urghhh'.'   Norton noted how Ford is going to have to talk about it for the rest of his life.   'I never thought of that, leave it to Graham, and now I feel more guilty,' Fisher laughed.   Later on during her appearance, Norton asked Fisher if their co-star Mark Hamill knew about the affair, to which she said he really didn't.   'When I told him, he was shocked, I think he felt a little betrayed quite honestly,' Fisher shared.     She told Norton that no one involved with the film knew about her and Ford.         'There is no other way to do it. I have a harder time eating properly than I do exercising,' she added.   'It's easier for me to add an activity than to deny myself something.   'When I do lose the weight I don't like that it makes me feel good about myself. It's not who I am. My problem is they talk to me like an actress but I hear them like a writer.'      Last month, the actress confessed to having a three-month affair with her co-star Harrison Ford while they filmed the movie.    She told People magazine: 'It was so intense. It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.'   Fisher was 19 at the time of the alleged affair in 1976, 14 years younger than Ford, who was 33.   Since news of her heart attack broke, Hollywood A-listers have flocked to social media to offer their prayers for the star, including her Star Wars co-stars.    Actor William Shatner tweeted: 'I ask everyone to stop for a moment and send special thoughts to @carrieffisher.'     Actor Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca in the iconic film, tweeted: 'Thoughts and prayers for our friend and everyone's favorite princess right now.. @carrieffisher'.   E.L James simply wrote: '2016, back away from @carrieffisher'.   Screenwriter Gary Whitta wrote: 'Be well @carrieffisher. Thoughts, hopes, and the Force are with you.'   Fisher had recently finished filming for 'Star Wars: Episode VIII,' which is the second of three new films in the massively popular series.   She first broke into Hollywood when she was cast in the role of Leia for the first Star Wars film, and then appeared in two sequels 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'.   Her other film roles include appearing in 'When Harry Met Sally', 'The Blues Brothers', 'The Burbs', and 'Shampoo'.    The author and actress may be best known for her portrayal of Leia, but she is also an accomplished writer known for no-holds-barred accounts of her struggles with addiction and mental illness.   She entered a drug treatment center in the mid-1980s to battle addiction to cocaine and later wrote the bestselling novel, 'Postcards From the Edge,' that was adapted into a 1987 film version starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep.   Fisher also transformed her one-woman show 'Wishful Drinking,' which played on Broadway and was filmed for HBO, into a book.     Could  Carrie Fisher's decades-long struggles with substance abuse and weight loss have caused her heart attack   The news that Star Wars legend  Fisher suffered a massive heart attack while on board a transatlantic flight has come as a shock to many.   But for those familiar with the star's own struggles in life, the horrifying announcement may not be unexpected.   Fisher is best known for her role as Leia, the Empire-busting space princess from the Star Wars movies, but she has long fought her own wars with drug addiction and weight loss.   Fisher was just 19 when she fought off Jodie Foster and Amy Irving, among others, to take the role of diplomat and rebel leader Princess Leia in 1977's Star Wars.   It was only her second movie, after Shampoo two years earlier, but it launched her to international stardom - and with it the Hollywood drug and party scene.   Fisher quickly became addicted to cocaine, the drug of choice in the late '70s, starting down a road she would struggle to leave for decades.   In an interview in 2010, while promoting her stand-up comedy show 'Wishful Drinking' in Sydney, she recalled how she had snorted the drug while shooting the movie's first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back.   'I didn\u2019t even like coke that much, it was just a case of getting on whatever train I needed to take to get high,\u2019 she said, adding that she was shooting scenes set on - ironically - the snow-bound planet of Hoth.   In fact, she claims, her addiction got so bad that even famously Bacchanalian comedian John Belushi - who died at the age of 33 overdosing on a mix of cocaine and speed - told her to calm it down.   'Slowly I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter,' she said.   'If I\u2019d been addicted to booze I\u2019d be dead now, because you just go out and get it.'   Despite mostly avoiding alcohol in her earlier years, she admitted to partying during filming, including one night spent with the Rolling Stones and co-star Harrison Ford at comedian Eric Idle's house.   She recalled how she broke her usual rule and decided to get drunk with the band, before rolling in to an early morning shoot on the set about two hours later.   'And we weren't hung over, we were still in our cups,' she said. 'And if you watch the movie you can see that: Harrison and I are smiling as we arrived in Cloud City. Doesn\u2019t that sound like a euphemism?'   Fisher was still using cocaine when the second sequel, The Return of the Jedi, was being shot.   In one scene, fans on Reddit noted, she has one fingernail longer than the others - leading to speculation that she used it to scoop up cocaine for her nose.   But Fisher blew that claim out of the water in spectacular fashion on Twitter: 'I never used my fingernail for drugs,' she said. 'I used dollars or tiny spoons like any other respectable former drug addict.'   Fisher jumped on and off the wagon for years, but in 2005 a shocking event pushed her back toward drugs.    R Gregory Stevens, a Republican lobbyist, came to her home along with a number of other people. He slept in her bed with her that night - and was dead by the time she woke up.   'And from the first moment I blamed myself,' Fisher told Vanity Fair in 2006. 'I thought I\u2019d put the pillow on his face. I was in shock for months.   'I thought I had killed him because it had happened on my watch and I had failed to save him.   'They say his body was so worn out from drug use that if it hadn\u2019t happened that night it would\u2019ve happened on another one.'   The autopsy report said Stevens died due to 'cocaine and oxycodone use'.   But it also said chronic, and apparently previously undiagnosed, heart disease was a contributing factor - an echo, perhaps, of this week's dreadful news.   Fisher told Vanity Fair that her house became haunted by Stevens' ghost, until she had him exorcised. 'I was a nut for a year, and in that year I took drugs again,' she said.   The actress has always been very open about blaming herself, not the Hollywood environment for her addictions.   'It's always been my responsibility, she said. 'If it was Hollywood [that was to blame] then we'd all be dope addicts.'   It wasn't just drugs that haunted Fisher, however, but problems with losing and gaining weight.   Those struggles began early: She only got the part of Princess Leia in 1976 on the agreement that she would lose 10lb.   And the pressure to stay trim continued right up until the third film, The Return of the Jedi, when she famously wore a gold metal bikini, showing off her perfectly flat stomach.   'I have serious body dysmorphia issues,' she told The Daily Beast last year. 'But I must admit being somewhat proud looking back at [the Return of the Jedi] photos.'   Fisher's life was haunted by weight loss and body issues. In 2011 she told Us Weekly that she hated 'wearing big clothes' and joked 'they have to make a new alphabet for my bra size'.   She then became a spokesperson for weight loss company Jenny Craig, a role she has continued in up to the present day.   In a cruel echo of her experience on the first Star Wars movie, when she returned to the role of Leia - now a military general - in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, she was once more told to drop weight for Hollywood.   Despite being clad in military fatigues for the film, she was told to shed a whole 35lbs before shooting began.   'They don\u2019t want to hire all of me, only about three-quarters,' she told Good Housekeeping last year.   'Nothing changes, it\u2019s an appearance-driven thing. I\u2019m in a business where the only thing that matters is weight and appearance.   'That is so messed up. They might as well say get younger, because that\u2019s how easy it is.'",

Crews recovered several bodies and ships, helicopters and drones were searching the area for more. \n Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said 10 bodies had been recovered so far. \n \"No survivors are seen,\" Konashenkov said. \n Magomed Tolboyev, a decorated Russian test pilot, said the circumstances of the crash indicated that all people on board have died. \n A total of 84 passengers and eight crew members were on the plane when it disappeared from radars two minutes after taking off in good weather. Emergency crews found fragments about 1.5 kilometers (less than one mile) from shore. There was no immediate word on the cause. \n Viktor Ozerov, head of the defense affairs committee at the upper house of Russian parliament, said the crash could have been caused by a technical malfunction or a crew error, but he believes it could not have been terrorism because the plane was operated by the military. \n \"I totally exclude\" the idea of an attack bringing down the plane, he said in remarks carried by state RIA Novosti news agency. \n The passenger list released by the Defense Ministry included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, among them its leader, Valery Khalilov. The ensemble is the official choir of the Russian military and also includes a band and a dance company. \n The military has repeatedly flown groups of Russian singers and artists to perform at Hemeimeem, which serves as the main hub for the Russian air campaign in Syria conducted since September 2015. New Year's is the main holiday for most Russians, and the Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 7 is also widely celebrated. \n Also on board was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work that included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said that Glinka was accompanying a shipment of medicines for a hospital in Syria. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin presented Glinka with an award earlier this month. \n \"We never feel sure that we will come back alive,\" she said at the Kremlin award ceremony. \"But we are sure that kindness, compassion and charity are stronger than any weapon.\" \n Nine Russian journalists from three Russian television stations were also among the passengers. \n Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was personally coordinating the rescue efforts, and President Vladimir Putin has received official reports on the incident. \n Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the crash as a \"terrible tragedy.\" \n The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively by carriers in Russia and worldwide. \n In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and some other government agencies in Russia have continued to use them. \n While noisy and fuel-guzzling by modern standards, the plane has been popular with crews that appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \n \"It's an excellent plane, which has proven its reliability during decades of service,\" veteran pilot Oleg Smirnov said in televised remarks. \n The plane that crashed was built in 1983, and underwent repairs in 2014, according to the Defense Ministry. \n In April 2010, a Tu-154 carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others crashed while trying to land in bad weather at a sporadically used military airport in Smolensk in western Russia, killing everyone on board. Investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather conditions, but Polish authorities have launched a new probe.",

However, some experts contested Ozerov's claim, saying the crew's failure to report a malfunction pointed at a possible terror attack.    'Possible malfunctions... certainly wouldn't have prevented the crew from reporting them,' Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told news agency RIA Novosti, adding that it points at an 'external impact'.    Russia's transport minister said all causes were being considered, including a terror attack.   Tu-154 aircraft have been involved in a number of accidents in the past.   In April 2010 many high-ranking Polish officials, including then president Lech Kaczynski, were killed when a Tu-154 airliner went down in thick fog while approaching the Smolensk airport in western Russia.   A Tu-154, operated by Siberian Airlines, was shot down over the Black Sea in October 2001, killing 78 people.   The plane was travelling from Tel Aviv in Israel to Novosibirsk in Russia, and most of the passengers were Israeli.     The plane, a Soviet-era design first introduced in the 1970s, had been on a routine flight to Russia's Hmeimim airbase in western Syria, which has been used to launch air strikes in Moscow's military campaign supporting its ally President Bashar al-Assad in the country's devastating civil war.    Among the 84 passengers on the plane were 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, the army's official musical group internationally known as the Red Army Choir, who were travelling to Syria to participate in New Year celebrations at the airbase.   The choir sang 'Get Lucky' at the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games that Russia hosted in Sochi, becoming an instant online sensation.     Ralina Gilmanova, 22, and her fianc\u00e9 Mikhail, who were members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, were also killed.   The young couple were engaged last year and due to marry soon.     A three-year-old boy was orphaned by the crash after his parents Oleg and Ekaterina Korzanov, dancers in the Red Army Choir, died in the crash.   The boy, Artem, who will be four in February, was staying with relatives.       Singer Alexander Shutko, 30, posted a haunting last photo minutes before the doomed flight crashed in the Black Sea.   His sister, Emma, said: 'Alexander called me and said 'we are already on board, taking off in 15 minutes, I'll call you when we stop in Sochi.   'But he didn't call us. We tried to contact him but his phone was out of coverage.'   She said he had been promised a soloist's role in the choir, that saw 64 of its members killed in the crash.   She said: 'He was so happy about his new job. He was promised a career of a soloist, he had a rare and beautiful voice.   He was engaged to Yulia, who wrote: 'My love, my life, you are the best in this world, I always told you this! Rest in peace.'     As word of the crash spread on Sunday, people placed bouquets of flowers outside the ensemble's Moscow headquarters.   'We all loved this ensemble,' said Moscow resident Mark Novikov. They are our brothers, our friends, our colleagues.'   Pavel Kogan, the director of Moscow State Academic Symphonic Orchestra, described the choir as 'a symbol of the country' and said the loss of the artistes was 'a nightmare'.    Nine journalists were among the passengers, with state-run channels Pervy Kanal, NTV and Zvezda saying they each had three staff onboard the flight.    There were also eight soldiers, two civil servants, and an NGO member.    There were also eight crew members on board.    Yelizaveta Glinka, a prominent charity activist and humanitarian worker who served on the Kremlin human rights council, was among the dead.   Mikhail Fedotov, who heads the council, said Glinka was travelling to Syria to bring medication to a university hospital near the airbase.   Anton Gubankov, the chief of the Directorate of Culture of the Russian Defense Ministry, was also killed.          The Alexandrov Ensemble is the official choir of the Russian military, and it also includes a band and a dancing company.     It was founded in 1928 during the Soviet era. It has for decades showcased its repertoire of famed Russian folksongs and spiritual music on the global stage.   During the Cold War period, when the USSR and the West were locked in a nuclear standoff, the group was one of the rare Soviet ensembles to tour beyond the Eastern bloc, playing a prominent role in the Kremlin's attempts to portray itself to the rest of the world.    It takes its name from its first director, Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov, who wrote the music to the national anthem of the Soviet Union.    The ensemble consists of between 100 and 120 members depending on the type of performance given.    Since their performance at the airbase in Syria was going to be mostly a cappella, only the choir and a handful dancers were aboard the plane, Russian media reported.       Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being kept updated on the search operation.    Putin said Russia will observe a national day of mourning tomorrow.          A spokesman for the defence ministry said: 'Fragments of the Tu-154 plane of the Russian defence ministry were found 1.5 kilometres from the Black Sea coast of the city of Sochi at a depth of 50 to 70 metres. No survivors have been spotted.   'Four ships, four helicopters, one aircraft and drones are involved in the search and rescue operation. Six ships and vessels of the Black Sea fleet, remotely operated submersibles and 63 divers have been additionally sent to the crash area. Fifty more divers from other fleets will be brought to the crash area in about an hour,' the ministry added.     Deputy Defence Minister Pavel Popov has flown to Adler to look into the circumstances surrounding the crash.    The plane underwent routine maintenance in September and was flown by an experienced pilot, according to the defence ministry. The aircraft had been in service since 1983 and flown some 7,000 hours since.   A source told the Interfax agency the plane had not sent an SOS signal. An audio recording played on Russian media and said to be of the final conversation between air traffic controllers and the plane showed no sign of any difficulties being faced by the crew.   Russia's Investigative Committee said a criminal probe had been launched to determine whether violations of air transportation safety had led to the crash.   Investigators are currently questioning the technical personnel responsible for preparing the plane for take-off, the committee said.    A security source indicated the plane had crashed because of a technical malfunction or a pilot error.    Russia's official weather forecast agency said conditions near the airport were 'normal, easy,' the Interfax news agency reported.     Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said: 'This awful tragedy has claimed the lives of people who were energetic and had plans. Among those killed are journalists, servicemen and musicians of the renowned Alexandrov ensemble. They flew to Syria with a very benevolent and peaceful mission.   'The circumstances of the incident will be thoroughly investigated, and everyone affected by this tragedy will receive the necessary assistance.'      A Russian jet was previously shot down in the Latakia region in November 2015.    In that incident, Su-24 was hit by air-to-air missiles fired by Turkish F-16s over the Syrian region.",

More than 7,000 years after they were embalmed by the Chinchorro people, an ancient civilization in modern-day Chile and Peru, 15 mummies were taken to a Santiago clinic last week to undergo DNA analysis and computerized tomography scans.   The Chinchorro were a hunting and fishing people who lived from 10,000 to 3,400 BC on the Pacific coast of South America, at the edge of the Atacama desert.   They were among the first people in the world to mummify their dead. Their mummies date back some 7,400 years -- at least 2,000 years older than Egypt's.   The 15 Chinchorro mummies, mostly children and unborn babies, were put through a CT scanner at the Los Condes clinic in the Chilean capital.   'We collected thousands of images with a precision of less than one millimeter,' said chief radiologist Marcelo Galvez.   'The next phase is to try to dissect these bodies virtually, without touching them, which will help us preserve them for another 500,000 years.'   Using high-tech computer processing, researchers are busy reconstructing the mummies' muscles and facial features.   'We want to see what they physically looked like, to reconstruct them and bring to life someone who died thousands of years ago,' said Galvez.   Researchers are also hoping to learn more about how the Chinchorro mummified their dead.   The Chinchorro, who apparently had a complex understanding of human anatomy, would carefully remove the skin and muscles of the deceased.   Using wood, plants and clay, they reconstructed the body around the remaining skeleton, then sewed the original skin back on, adding a mouth, eyes and hair.   A mask was then placed over the face.   The result looks like something in between a statue and a person - eerily lifelike even after thousands of years.   Mummification was an intimate process for the Chinchorro, said Veronica Silva, the head of the anthropology department at Chile's National Museum of Natural History.   'The family itself would make the mummy,' she told AFP. The earliest mummies were unborn fetuses and newborns, she said.   The mummies were all made using the same basic process, but each one shows unique 'technological and artistic innovations', she said.   It was a process that evolved over time. The newest mummies are the most elaborate.   While some of the earliest mummies found in the Atacama desert appear to have been the result of natural preservation in the extremely dry conditions, around 5,000 BC, the Chinchorro people began deliberately preserving their dead.   Although the practice began 2,000 years before the Ancient Egyptians began mummifying their own dead, the techniques used by the Chinchorro were often surprisingly sophisticated.   They would often take the most care when preserving the remains of dead children and babies - suggesting the act had a deep significance with linking the living to the dead.   First the Chinchorro would extract the brains and organs before then reconstructing the body with fibres.   They would fill the empty skull with straw or ash.   Reeds were then used to sew it back together and connect the jaw to the cranium.   A stick was used to keep the spine straight and the skin was patched back together before being covered with a paste made from manganese, red ocher or mud.    Some 180 Chinchorro mummies have been discovered since 1903.   All were found outdoors, placed near the beach. The Chinchorro apparently did not build pyramids or any other structures to house them.   In fact, the Chinchorro civilization left no trace besides its mummies.   'We are effectively talking about the oldest artificially mummified bodies in the world,' said Silva.   'The Chinchorro mummies date to 7,400 years ago. That is to say, this system... existed 2,000 years before the first mummifications even began in Egypt.'   Surprises have already begun to emerge from the CT scanner.   The smallest mummy, it turns out, was not a mummy at all.   'There was no bone structure inside. It was just a figurine, possibly a representation of an individual who could not be mummified,' said Silva.   Researchers also took skin and hair samples from the mummies to analyze their DNA, in hopes of identifying genetic links with the modern-day population.   'We want to better understand their way of life -- from their diet to whether we Chileans still carry their genes,' said Silva.",
