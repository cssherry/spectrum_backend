   "content": "Japan's whaling fleet returned home Friday after killing 333 whales in the Antarctic, achieving its goal for the second year under a revised research whaling program. \n The Fisheries Agency said the five-ship fleet finished its four-month expedition without major interference from anti-whaling activists who have attempted to stop it in the past. \n Japan says the hunt was for ecological research. Research whaling is allowed as an exception to a 1986 international ban on commercial whaling. Opponents of the Japanese program say it's a cover for commercial whaling because the whales are sold for food. \n The International Court of Justice ruled in 2014 that Japan's Antarctic whaling program should stop because it wasn't scientific as Tokyo had claimed. Japan conducted non-lethal whaling research in the Antarctic in 2015, and revised its program in 2016 by reducing the catch quota to about one-third of what it used to kill. \n \"It was great that we have achieved our plan. We will steadily continue our research toward a resumption of commercial whaling,\" Fisheries Agency official Shigeto Hase said at a welcome ceremony in Shimonoseki, home port for the fleet's mother ship, Nisshin Maru. \n Officials said the whalers used parts of the whales to determine their age, nutrition, and reproductive conditions. Opponents say such studies can be done using non-lethal methods. \n Kitty Block, executive vice president of Humane Society International, an animal protection group based in Washington D.C., said Japan is needlessly killing whales every year. \"It is an obscene cruelty in the name of science that must end,\" she said in a statement. \n Japan has hunted whales for centuries as a source of protein and cheaper alternative to other meats. Its whale catch has fallen in recent years in part because of declining domestic demand for whale meat. Protests by the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd have also contributed to the decline. \n Critics say it's a dying industry, but Japan's government has spent large amounts of tax money to sustain the whaling operations, saying it's a Japanese cultural tradition that must be preserved.",

   "content": "The company that created a discredited dossier for President Trump\u2019s campaign rivals and was later used by the FBI in its probe of possible links between Trump and Russia has its own Kremlin connection, according to a powerful U.S. Senator. \n Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an investigation into Washington-based Fusion GPS, which produced the 35-page Trump dossier with help from ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Grassley wants to know why the FBI might seek evidence tying Trump to Russia from a firm whose own hands may not be clean. \n \u201cThe issue is of particular concern to the Senate Judiciary Committee given that when Fusion GPS reportedly was acting as an unregistered agent of Russian interests, it appears to have been simultaneously overseeing the creation of the unsubstantiated dossier of allegations of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians,\u201d Grassley said in a letter to the Department of Justice. \n The dossier, containing salacious allegations pointing to collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, was leaked to the media in January, prompting Trump to deny its contents. It later emerged that the FBI had hired Steele to dig into Trump\u2019s purported Russia links even as Russian operatives hired Fusion GPS for a separate high profile political battle. \n According to a  complaint filed with the Justice Department , Fusion GPS headed the pro-Russia campaign to kill the Global Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on Russians designated as human rights abusers. This was the same time, Grassley said, that the FBI was relying on the anti-Trump dossier and the man who produced it for Fusion to further its investigation into Trump and his Russian ties. \n It is \u201cunclear whether the FBI was aware of the company\u2019s pro-Russia activities\u201d when the FBI reportedly hired its researcher to further the research on Trump and \u201c\u2026when evaluating the credibility of the dossier the company helped create,\u201d Grassley said.   \n The Global Magnitsky Act, which is named for an attorney who died while in the custody of the Russian government after he accused the Russian government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Hermitage Capital Management. \n The U.S. Justice Department in 2013  opened a case  against the Russian-owned Prevezon Holdings, which had purchased real estate in New York with the stolen funds, according to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint. \n Prevezon Holdings, backed by the Kremlin, launched a campaign to undermine the Magnitsky Act, Grassley said, citing a 2016 complaint by Hermitage CEO William Browder.  \n Fusion GPS was hired to generate negative press coverage on the Russians\u2019 behalf, Grassley said. And Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian immigrant who has reportedly acknowledged being a Russian counterintelligence officer, lobbied congressional staffers to repeal the Magnitsky Act itself, Grassley said.  \n \u201cIt is particularly disturbing that Mr. Akhmetshin and Fusion GPS were working together on this pro-Russia lobbying effort in 2016 in light of Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s history and reputation,\u201d Grassley said, citing reports Akhmetshin worked for the GRU, Russia's foreign intelligence agency and allegedly specializes in \u201csubversive political influence operations often involving disinformation and propaganda.\u201d \n The relationship between Fusion GPS and Akhmetshin casts further doubt on the dossier used against Trump, Grassley said. \n \u201cFusion GPS is the company behind the creation of the unsubstantiated dossier alleging a conspiracy between President Trump and Russia,\u201d Grassley wrote in the letter. \u201cIt is highly troubling that Fusion GPS appears to have been working with someone with ties to Russian intelligence \u2013let alone someone alleged to have conducted political disinformation campaigns\u2013 as part of a pro-Russia lobbying effort while also simultaneously overseeing the creation of the Trump/Russia dossier.\u201d \n Fusion GPS maintained in a statement to Fox News Friday that it is not required to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, because it partnered with a U.S. law firm to ensure compliance with the law. The company did not respond to inquiries about the dossier, its relationship to Russia or any business dealings with the FBI. \n The FBI declined comment on its relationship to Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele or Grassley\u2019s inquiry. \n Grassley\u2019s committee has launched a separate probe into allegations the FBI wrongly included political opposition research from Trump\u2019s opponents in its probe, and then paid the author of that controversial report, Steele, to consult on its investigation.  \n \n Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

   "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013   President Donald Trump's son-in-law and daughter are holding onto scores of real estate investments \u2014 part of a portfolio of at least $240 million in assets \u2014 while they serve in White House jobs, according to financial disclosures released publicly late Friday. \n Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser, resigned from more than 260 entities and sold off 58 businesses or investments that lawyers identified as posing potential conflicts of interest, the documents show. \n But his lawyers, in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics, determined that his real estate assets, many of them in New York City, are unlikely to pose the kinds of conflicts that would trigger a need to divest. \n \"The remaining conflicts, from a practical perspective, are pretty narrow and very manageable,\" said Jamie Gorelick, an attorney who has been working on the ethics agreements for Kushner and Ivanka Trump. \n TOP DEM PUSHES BACK ON FLYNN IMMUNITY, AS TRUMP URGES TESTIMONY \n Kushner began selling off the most problematic pieces of his portfolio shortly after Trump won the election, and some of those business deals predate what is required to be captured in the financial disclosure forms. For example, Kushner sold his stake in a Manhattan skyscraper to a trust his mother oversees. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and their three minor children have no financial interest in that trust, his lawyer said. The Kushner Companies, now run by Jared Kushner's relatives, are seeking investment partners for a massive redevelopment. \n The White House on Friday began released financial disclosure forms for more than 100 or its top administration officials \u2014 a mix of people far wealthier, and therefore more entangled in businesses that could conflict with their government duties, than people in previous administrations. \n White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer described the business people who have joined the administration as \"very blessed and very successful,\" and said the disclosure forms will show that they have set aside \"a lot\" to go into public service. \n The financial disclosures \u2014 required by law to be made public \u2014 give a snapshot of the employees' finances as they entered the White House. What's not being provided: the Office of Government Ethics agreements with those employees on what they must do to avoid potential conflicts of interest. \n Those documents will never be made public, White House lawyers said, although the public will eventually have access to \"certificates of divestiture\" issued to employees who are seeking capital gains tax deferrals for selling off certain assets. \n Kushner, for example, received certificates of divestitures for his financial interests in several assets, including several funds tied to Thrive Capital, his brother Joshua Kushner's investment firm. \n He and Ivanka Trump built up companies the documents show are worth at least $50 million each and have stepped away from their businesses while in government service. Like the president himself, however, they retain a financial interest in many of them. Ivanka Trump agreed this week to become a federal employee and will file her own financial disclosure at a later date. \n Jared Kushner's disclosure shows he took on tens of millions of dollars of bank debt in 2015 and 2016, including liabilities with several international banks whose interests could come before the Trump administration. \n Financial information for members of Trump's Cabinet who needed Senate confirmation has, in most cases, been available for weeks through the Office of Government Ethics. \n The president must also file periodic financial disclosures, but he is not required to make another disclosure until next year.",

The report based its investigation on the fact that to meet the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature limit, the global energy system must completely decarbonize by midcentury.

These gave certainty to investors and triggered the massive growth and price drops we see today.

Again, we find this change was started by just a few key players, this time Norway, the Netherlands, California and, more recently, China,\u201d said Sebastian Sterl, of NewClimate Institute.</p><p>The type of successful policy packages that kick-started the sector often include a focus on targets for takeup, campaigns on behavioural change, infrastructure investment\u2014especially important for electric vehicles\u2014and research and development.</p><p>The final sector studied in the report is buildings, which is lagging behind the other two sectors.</p><p>\u201cWith the building sector, there are proven technological solutions that can result in new, zero-carbon buildings. Innovative financial mechanisms to increase the rate of retrofitting buildings, as well as good examples of building codes for new builds, would drive adoption of these technologies,\u201d said Yvonne Deng of Ecofys, an energy consultancy.</p><p>The report makes a number of recommendations as to how decarbonization in those sectors can meet the Paris Agreement challenge, such as increasing flexibility in power systems to integrate larger shares of renewable energy, and more countries adopting policies in the electric vehicle market and on building standards.</p><p><em>Download the <a href=\"http://twitter.us2.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=30bad7ecd5ffe55e94eebeb4a&amp;id=86c7909a47&amp;e=192b9b0840\" target=\"_blank\">executive summary</a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http://twitter.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=30bad7ecd5ffe55e94eebeb4a&amp;id=a724477784&amp;e=192b9b0840\">full report</a>.</em></p> &nbsp;<h3 style=\"clear: left; padding-top: 10px;\">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/environment/almost-half-trump-voters-want-us-stay-paris-climate-agreement\" rel=\"nofollow\">Almost Half of Trump Voters Want the U.S. to Stay in the Paris Climate Agreement</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/environment/trump-team-sharply-divided-over-paris-climate-agreement\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trump Team Sharply Divided Over Paris Climate Agreement</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/environment/how-climate-change-leads-violent-conflict-around-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">How Climate Change Leads to Violent Conflict Around the World</a></li></ul>",

   "content": "PYONGYANG, North Korea --  A U.S. guided-missile submarine arrived in South Korea Tuesday and envoys from the U.S., Japan and South Korea met in Tokyo as North Korea marked the anniversary of the founding of its military. Though experts thought a nuclear test or ballistic missile launch was possible around the anniversary, the morning came and went without either. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency, citing a South Korean government source, reported that North Korea instead appeared to have held a major live-fire drill in the Wonsan city area. South Korea\u2019s military said it\u2019s closely watching North Korean troop movement around Wonsan, but didn\u2019t confirm the Yonhap report, which cited an unnamed source to report that the North carried out an exercise involving 300 to 400 artillery pieces. Yonhap said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely observed what was one of the country\u2019s largest artillery drills. Crowds in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, laid flowers and paid respects at giant statues of the country\u2019s former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, a day after the minister of defense reiterated the assertion that North is ready to use pre-emptive strikes or any other measures it deems necessary to defend itself against the \u201cU.S. imperialists.\u201d \u201cThe situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula is so tense that a nuclear war may break out due to the frantic war drills of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces for aggression,\u201d Gen. Pak Yong Sik said at a \u201cnational meeting\u201d of thousands of senior military and civilian officials. A ruling Chinese Communist Party newspaper warned North Korea Tuesday against conducting another nuclear test, saying that would likely propel events past the \u201cpoint of no return.\u201d In an editorial, the Global Times said the previous day\u2019s phone conversation between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping of China showed the two countries were in close communication over the tensions. It said China hopes for a peaceful outcome, but that Beijing has \u201cvery limited influence on the entire situation.\u201d It said, \u201cThe game of chicken between Washington and Pyongyang has come to a breaking point.\u201d The paper is known for its often stridently nationalistic views. The newspaper said if North Korea carries out a sixth nuclear test as expected, \u201cIt is more likely than ever that the situation will cross the point of no return. All stakeholders will bear the consequences, with Pyongyang sure to suffer the greatest losses.\u201d As a traditional ally and North Korea\u2019s chief source of trade, food and fuel aid, China has come under intense pressure to use its influence to dissuade Pyongyang from additional nuclear tests and missile launches. However, Beijing is intensely wary of any measures that might cause the collapse of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s hard-line communist regime, fearing that could lead to a wave of refugees and a Pyongyang government beholden to Washington and Seoul. The streets of Pyongyang were quiet Tuesday. Flower-laying and bowing at statues and portraits of the leaders is a regular routine on major anniversaries. Groups of people also gathered in open spaces around the city to take part in organized dancing sessions, another common way of marking holidays in North Korea. \u201cOur great leaders founded and wisely led our revolutionary army, and just like that, now our respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is leading wisely, so even though the situation is tense, we are celebrating the day,\u201d said Choe Un Byol, who had come with his family to the bronze statues of the former leaders. North Korea often marks significant dates by displaying its military capability and has conducted five nuclear tests.  Pyongyang launched a missile  one day after the 105th birthday of late founder Kim Il Sung on April 15. Recent U.S. commercial satellite images indicate increased activity around North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site, and third-generation dictator Kim Jong Un has said the country\u2019s preparation for an ICBM launch is in its \u201cfinal stage.\u201d South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry has said North Korea appears ready to conduct such \u201cstrategic provocations\u201d at any time. South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country\u2019s acting leader, has instructed his military to strengthen its \u201cimmediate response posture\u201d in case North Korea does something significant on Tuesday\u2019s anniversary. The nuclear-powered USS Michigan submarine arrived at Busan in what was described as a routine port visit to rest the crew and load supplies. Cmdr. Jang Wook from the South Korean navy public affairs office said there is no plan for any drill. The submarine\u2019s arrival comes as the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier heads toward the Korean Peninsula for a joint exercise with South Korea around the weekend. Despite the buildup, Mr. Trump has reportedly settled on a strategy that emphasizes increased pressure on North Korea with the help of China, the North\u2019s only major ally, instead of military options or trying to overthrow North Korea\u2019s government. Mr. Trump has told ambassadors from U.N. Security Council member countries that they  must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korea . \u201cThis is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a White House meeting Monday. \u201cNorth Korea is a big world problem, and it\u2019s a problem we have to finally solve. People have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it\u2019s time to solve the problem.\u201d Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump\u2019s U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. isn\u2019t looking for a fight with Kim and wouldn\u2019t attack North Korea \u201cunless he gives us reason to do something.\u201d She praised China\u2019s increased pressure on North Korea. Asked about the threshold for U.S. action, Haley told NBC News, \u201cIf you see him attack a military base, if you see some sort of intercontinental ballistic missile, then obviously we\u2019re going to do that.\u201d But asked what if North Korea tests an intercontinental missile or nuclear device, she said, \u201cI think then the president steps in and decides what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d U.S. representative for North Korea Policy Joseph Yun met Tuesday with his Japanese counterpart Kenji Kanasugi and Kim Hong-kyun of South Korea. Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the three envoys were to deepen cooperation and ensure their countries stay on the same page amid growing tension. Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry also announced that China\u2019s envoy for North Korea, Wu Dawei, is arriving in Tokyo on Tuesday for talks with Kanasugi, which may take place later this week.",

South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency, citing a South Korean government source, reported that North Korea instead appeared to have held a major live-fire drill in the Wonsan city area.</p><p>South Korea\u2019s military said it\u2019s closely watching North Korean troop movement around Wonsan, but didn\u2019t confirm the Yonhap report, which cited an unnamed source to report that the North carried out an exercise involving 300 to 400 artillery pieces.</p><p>Yonhap said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely observed what was one of the country\u2019s largest artillery drills.</p><p>Crowds in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, laid flowers and paid respects at giant statues of the country\u2019s former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, a day after the minister of defense reiterated the assertion that North is ready to use pre-emptive strikes or any other measures it deems necessary to defend itself against the \u201cU.S. imperialists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula is so tense that a nuclear war may break out due to the frantic war drills of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces for aggression,\u201d Gen. Pak Yong Sik said at a \u201cnational meeting\u201d of thousands of senior military and civilian officials.</p><p>A ruling Chinese Communist Party newspaper warned North Korea Tuesday against conducting another nuclear test, saying that would likely propel events past the \u201cpoint of no return.\u201d</p><p>In an editorial, the Global Times said the previous day\u2019s phone conversation between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping of China showed the two countries were in close communication over the tensions.</p><p>It said China hopes for a peaceful outcome, but that Beijing has \u201cvery limited influence on the entire situation.\u201d</p><p>It said, \u201cThe game of chicken between Washington and Pyongyang has come to a breaking point.\u201d The paper is known for its often stridently nationalistic views.</p><p>The newspaper said if North Korea carries out a sixth nuclear test as expected, \u201cIt is more likely than ever that the situation will cross the point of no return. All stakeholders will bear the consequences, with Pyongyang sure to suffer the greatest losses.\u201d</p><p>As a traditional ally and North Korea\u2019s chief source of trade, food and fuel aid, China has come under intense pressure to use its influence to dissuade Pyongyang from additional nuclear tests and missile launches.</p><p>However, Beijing is intensely wary of any measures that might cause the collapse of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s hard-line communist regime, fearing that could lead to a wave of refugees and a Pyongyang government beholden to Washington and Seoul.</p><p>The streets of Pyongyang were quiet Tuesday. Flower-laying and bowing at statues and portraits of the leaders is a regular routine on major anniversaries. Groups of people also gathered in open spaces around the city to take part in organized dancing sessions, another common way of marking holidays in North Korea.</p><p>\u201cOur great leaders founded and wisely led our revolutionary army, and just like that, now our respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is leading wisely, so even though the situation is tense, we are celebrating the day,\u201d said Choe Un Byol, who had come with his family to the bronze statues of the former leaders.</p><p>North Korea often marks significant dates by displaying its military capability and has conducted five nuclear tests. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/details-missile-in-failed-north-korea-test/\">Pyongyang launched a missile</a> one day after the 105th birthday of late founder Kim Il Sung on April 15.</p><p>Recent U.S. commercial satellite images indicate increased activity around North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site, and third-generation dictator Kim Jong Un has said the country\u2019s preparation for an ICBM launch is in its \u201cfinal stage.\u201d</p><p>South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry has said North Korea appears ready to conduct such \u201cstrategic provocations\u201d at any time. South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country\u2019s acting leader, has instructed his military to strengthen its \u201cimmediate response posture\u201d in case North Korea does something significant on Tuesday\u2019s anniversary.</p><p>The nuclear-powered USS Michigan submarine arrived at Busan in what was described as a routine port visit to rest the crew and load supplies. Cmdr. Jang Wook from the South Korean navy public affairs office said there is no plan for any drill.</p><p>The submarine\u2019s arrival comes as the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier heads toward the Korean Peninsula for a joint exercise with South Korea around the weekend.</p><p>Despite the buildup, Mr. Trump has reportedly settled on a strategy that emphasizes increased pressure on North Korea with the help of China, the North\u2019s only major ally, instead of military options or trying to overthrow North Korea\u2019s government.</p><p>Mr. Trump has told ambassadors from U.N. Security Council member countries that they <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-u-n-must-be-ready-to-impose-new-sanctions-on-north-korea/\">must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korea</a>.</p><p>\u201cThis is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a White House meeting Monday. \u201cNorth Korea is a big world problem, and it\u2019s a problem we have to finally solve. People have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it\u2019s time to solve the problem.\u201d</p><p>Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump\u2019s U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. isn\u2019t looking for a fight with Kim and wouldn\u2019t attack North Korea \u201cunless he gives us reason to do something.\u201d She praised China\u2019s increased pressure on North Korea.</p><p>Asked about the threshold for U.S. action, Haley told NBC News, \u201cIf you see him attack a military base, if you see some sort of intercontinental ballistic missile, then obviously we\u2019re going to do that.\u201d</p><p>But asked what if North Korea tests an intercontinental missile or nuclear device, she said, \u201cI think then the president steps in and decides what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>U.S. representative for North Korea Policy Joseph Yun met Tuesday with his Japanese counterpart Kenji Kanasugi and Kim Hong-kyun of South Korea. Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the three envoys were to deepen cooperation and ensure their countries stay on the same page amid growing tension.</p><p>Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry also announced that China\u2019s envoy for North Korea, Wu Dawei, is arriving in Tokyo on Tuesday for talks with Kanasugi, which may take place later this week.</p></div>\n    </div>",

   "content": "WASHINGTON --  The Senate on Monday confirmed former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue to be agriculture secretary in President Trump\u2019s administration as the farming industry looks to Washington for help amid a downturn in the market.  Perdue won confirmation on a strong bipartisan vote of 87-11, as several Democrats backed a Mr. Trump nominee after razor-thin outcomes for his choices earlier this year. Perdue\u2019s cousin, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., voted \u201cpresent\u201d but presided over the vote and announced the final tally.  The son of a farmer from Bonaire, Georgia, Sonny Perdue will be the first Southerner in the post in more than two decades. He has owned several agricultural businesses, but isn\u2019t related to or affiliated with the food company Perdue or the poultry producer Perdue Farms.  At his confirmation hearing in March, Perdue assured nervous farm-state senators that he will advocate for rural America, even as Mr. Trump has proposed deep cuts to some farm programs. He also promised to reach out to Democrats.  \n \n \n \n 50 \n Photos \n \n Trump's team \n \n                                            A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle\n                                     \n \n Still, Perdue, 70, is getting a late start on the job. Mr. Trump nominated him just two days before his inauguration, and then the nomination was delayed for weeks as the administration prepared his ethics paperwork. Perdue eventually said he would step down from several companies bearing his name to avoid conflicts of interest.  As agriculture secretary, he\u2019ll be in charge of around 100,000 employees and the nation\u2019s food and farm programs, including agricultural subsidies, conservation efforts, rural development programs, food safety and nutrition programs such as food stamps and federally-subsidized school meal,  Perdue will take office as farm prices have been down for several years in a row and some parts of the industry, including cotton and dairy farmers, say they need the department and Congress to rewrite agricultural policy to help revive their business.  Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said Perdue will help facilitate recovery in small American towns.  \u201cI know he will put the needs of farmers, ranchers and others in rural America first,\u201d Roberts said.  Perdue\u2019s main task over the coming year will be working with Congress and coordinating his department\u2019s input on the next five-year farm bill. Current farm policy expires next year, and lawmakers on the House and Senate agriculture committees will have to find a way to push it through Congress amid heightened partisan tensions and concerns over spending.  At his hearing, he pledged to help senators sustain popular crop insurance programs and fix problems with government dairy programs.  Perdue may also find himself in the uncomfortable position of defending agriculture in an administration that has so far given the issue limited attention, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s strong support in rural areas. Mr. Trump has proposed a 21 percent cut in USDA programs and has harshly criticized some international trade deals, saying they have killed American jobs. But farmers who produce more than they can sell in the United States have heavily profited from some of those deals, and are hoping his anti-trade policies will include some exceptions for agriculture.  At the hearing, Perdue said, \u201cFood is a noble thing to trade.\u201d  Perdue will also be part of the administration\u2019s response to a dispute with Canada\u2019s dairy industry, which has a new lower-priced classification of milk product that Mr. Trump says is harming U.S. producers in dairy states like Wisconsin and New York. Canada changed its policy on pricing domestic milk to cover more dairy ingredients, leading to lower prices for Canadian products that compete with U.S. milk.  Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, voted for Perdue and encouraged him to come to Wisconsin to talk to affected farmers.  \u201cI stand as a willing partner to work with Secretary Perdue and President Trump to address this urgent issue,\u201d Baldwin said.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York also talked to Mr. Trump about the dairy issue last week in a rare phone call between the two men.  Mr. Trump has reached out to farmers on regulation, saying the government has too many rules that negatively affect farm country. That issue is expected to come up on Perdue\u2019s first day in office Tuesday, when the president holds hold a round table discussion with farmers and sign an executive order \u201cto provide relief for rural America,\u201d according to the White House.  The White House hasn\u2019t said when Perdue will be sworn in, but he is scheduled to speak to USDA staff Tuesday morning.  After Perdue, remaining nominees for Mr. Trump\u2019s administration to be confirmed are Robert Lighthizer for U.S. trade representative and Alexander Acosta for labor secretary.",

Sonny Perdue to be agriculture secretary in President Trump\u2019s administration as the farming industry looks to Washington for help amid a downturn in the market. </p><p>Perdue won confirmation on a strong bipartisan vote of 87-11, as several Democrats backed a Mr. Trump nominee after razor-thin outcomes for his choices earlier this year. Perdue\u2019s cousin, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., voted \u201cpresent\u201d but presided over the vote and announced the final tally. </p><p>The son of a farmer from Bonaire, Georgia, Sonny Perdue will be the first Southerner in the post in more than two decades. He has owned several agricultural businesses, but isn\u2019t related to or affiliated with the food company Perdue or the poultry producer Perdue Farms. </p><p>At his confirmation hearing in March, Perdue assured nervous farm-state senators that he will advocate for rural America, even as Mr. Trump has proposed deep cuts to some farm programs. He also promised to reach out to Democrats. </p><div class=\"shortcode-gallery shortcode large left \" id=\"shortcode-gallery\">\n    <a href=\"/pictures/donald-trumps-team\" data-omniture-track=\"trackGalleryOverlayView\" data-omniture-track-data='{\"siteSection\":\"Politics\",\"siteHier\":[\"Politics\"],\"pageType\":\"image_gallery\",\"photoGalleryTitle\":\"Trump\\u0027s team\",\"photoGalleryId\":\"085d84dc-7118-4860-b119-dd0a35d9cdd0\",\"topicId\":[\"4a6eba46-758d-11e2-9d12-0018fe8a00b0\"],\"topicName\":[\"Politics\"],\"articleType\":\"content_gallery\",\"articleAuthorId\":[\"c7425b13-050b-415a-99ee-60b168058f9a\"],\"articleAuthorName\":[\"Elisha Fieldstadt\"],\"collectionId\":[\"58b6b11b-d542-4c73-a1b4-400f78f36e7e\"],\"collectionName\":[\"Campaign 2016\"]}'>\n        <figure class=\"gallery overlay-gallery\"><span class=\"img \"><img src=\"http://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/11/18/c0623f15-12c4-4abf-9113-c964e6f88c0c/thumbnail/380x240g2/bd8a45dcd78ad8cd42d8ea1d26bb6507/gettyimages-622159424.jpg#\" alt=\"Trump's team \" height=\"240\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"http://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/11/18/c0623f15-12c4-4abf-9113-c964e6f88c0c/thumbnail/380x240g2/bd8a45dcd78ad8cd42d8ea1d26bb6507/gettyimages-622159424.jpg 1x, http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/11/18/c0623f15-12c4-4abf-9113-c964e6f88c0c/thumbnail/760x480g2/c496b281f0d67674c3ce4c18709245ba/gettyimages-622159424.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAI=\"></span>\n\n            <figcaption><div class=\"meta\">\n                    <span class=\"count\">50</span>\n                    <span class=\"label\">Photos</span>\n                </div>\n                <h3 class=\"title\">Trump's team</h3>\n                <p class=\"dek\">\n                                            A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle\n                                    </p>\n            </figcaption></figure></a>\n</div><p>Still, Perdue, 70, is getting a late start on the job. Mr. Trump nominated him just two days before his inauguration, and then the nomination was delayed for weeks as the administration prepared his ethics paperwork. Perdue eventually said he would step down from several companies bearing his name to avoid conflicts of interest. </p><p>As agriculture secretary, he\u2019ll be in charge of around 100,000 employees and the nation\u2019s food and farm programs, including agricultural subsidies, conservation efforts, rural development programs, food safety and nutrition programs such as food stamps and federally-subsidized school meal, </p><p>Perdue will take office as farm prices have been down for several years in a row and some parts of the industry, including cotton and dairy farmers, say they need the department and Congress to rewrite agricultural policy to help revive their business. </p><p>Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said Perdue will help facilitate recovery in small American towns. </p><p>\u201cI know he will put the needs of farmers, ranchers and others in rural America first,\u201d Roberts said. </p><p>Perdue\u2019s main task over the coming year will be working with Congress and coordinating his department\u2019s input on the next five-year farm bill. Current farm policy expires next year, and lawmakers on the House and Senate agriculture committees will have to find a way to push it through Congress amid heightened partisan tensions and concerns over spending. </p><p>At his hearing, he pledged to help senators sustain popular crop insurance programs and fix problems with government dairy programs. </p><p>Perdue may also find himself in the uncomfortable position of defending agriculture in an administration that has so far given the issue limited attention, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s strong support in rural areas. Mr. Trump has proposed a 21 percent cut in USDA programs and has harshly criticized some international trade deals, saying they have killed American jobs. But farmers who produce more than they can sell in the United States have heavily profited from some of those deals, and are hoping his anti-trade policies will include some exceptions for agriculture. </p><p>At the hearing, Perdue said, \u201cFood is a noble thing to trade.\u201d </p><p>Perdue will also be part of the administration\u2019s response to a dispute with Canada\u2019s dairy industry, which has a new lower-priced classification of milk product that Mr. Trump says is harming U.S. producers in dairy states like Wisconsin and New York. Canada changed its policy on pricing domestic milk to cover more dairy ingredients, leading to lower prices for Canadian products that compete with U.S. milk. </p><p>Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, voted for Perdue and encouraged him to come to Wisconsin to talk to affected farmers. </p><p>\u201cI stand as a willing partner to work with Secretary Perdue and President Trump to address this urgent issue,\u201d Baldwin said. </p><p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York also talked to Mr. Trump about the dairy issue last week in a rare phone call between the two men. </p><p>Mr. Trump has reached out to farmers on regulation, saying the government has too many rules that negatively affect farm country. That issue is expected to come up on Perdue\u2019s first day in office Tuesday, when the president holds hold a round table discussion with farmers and sign an executive order \u201cto provide relief for rural America,\u201d according to the White House. </p><p>The White House hasn\u2019t said when Perdue will be sworn in, but he is scheduled to speak to USDA staff Tuesday morning. </p><p>After Perdue, remaining nominees for Mr. Trump\u2019s administration to be confirmed are Robert Lighthizer for U.S. trade representative and Alexander Acosta for labor secretary. </p></div>\n    </div>",
