   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korea's just-ousted president returned home early Wednesday after being grilled by prosecutors in a long-awaited investigation of corruption allegations that ended her rule and now threaten to put her in jail.   The questioning of Park Geun-hye came 11 days after the Constitutional Court unanimously ruled to dismiss her over suspicions she colluded with a confidante to extort money from businesses and committed other wrongdoings. Her powers had been suspended since she was impeached by parliament in December.   \"I am sorry to the people. I will sincerely undergo an investigation,\" Park told reporters, without elaborating, when she arrived at the prosecutors' office on Tuesday.   It was not clear if Park's brief statement meant she acknowledged the corruption allegations, since she has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing. South Korean politicians embroiled in scandals often offer public apologies for causing trouble though they deny any involvement.   Park's questioning lasted 14 hours and ended just before midnight. She spent about seven more hours at the prosecutors' office reviewing their report to check whether they accurately described her testimony.   When she left the prosecutors' office and got into a black sedan waiting for her, Park didn't make any comments to reporters. But when she arrived at her home in southern Seoul, live TV footage showed Park smiling, talking to ruling party lawmakers and giving a nod in gestures of greetings several times for dozens of flag-waving supporters who lined up streets leading up to her residence.   In Park's questioning, prosecutors tried to determine whether to seek an arrest warrant, according to South Korean media. Many other suspects implicated in the scandal have already been arrested, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, some top government officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   Prosecutors have previously accused Park of extortion, bribery and abuse of power, which could theoretically carry penalties of up to life imprisonment. But arresting Park would be a delicate matter because it might aggravate a national divide and create a strong conservative backlash ahead of an election in May to choose her successor, some political experts said.   Park's scandal has roiled South Korea for months, with those opposing and supporting her rule staging massive rallies. After the March 10 Constitutional Court ruling, Park supporters clashed with police, leaving three dead. On Tuesday, hundreds of Park's supporters waited for hours outside the prosecutors' office, holding anti-impeachment signs and the national flag, which has become a symbol of their protest.   Park had immunity while in office and had refused to meet with prosecutors or allow officials to search her presidential compound. After leaving office, she has continued to reject the allegations, saying \"I believe the truth will certainly come out.\"   Park is the first democratically elected leader to be forced out of office in South Korea since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It was a dramatic fall for Park, the daughter of slain dictator Park Chung-hee who became the country's first female president in early 2013 with the backing of conservatives who remembered her father as a hero who pulled the country up from poverty despite his suppression of civil rights.   Moon Jae-in, a liberal who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, currently has a commanding lead in opinion surveys for next leader.   ___   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this story.",

   "content": "By  Ju-min Park \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  Park Geun-hye's hairdresser came as usual on Tuesday morning to coif the former South Korean president's hair in the cropped chignon style favored by her mother, before she was assassinated more than four decades ago. Emerging from her secluded home in Seoul's Gangnam neighborhood for the first time since leaving the presidential Blue House nine days earlier, Park squinted in the bright morning light at the hundreds of supporters gathered outside. \"A lot of people came out,\" she said, waving goodbye before driving off in a motorcade to meet prosecutors for a marathon interrogation that could lead to criminal charges. If convicted, she could be put behind bars for years. It had to be a daunting prospect for a 65-year-old woman dubbed the \"notebook princess\" for her privileged upbringing and reliance on prepared scripts for public appearances. \"She must be miserable and may want to kill herself - it's so heart-breaking,\" said Park Sung-hye, a supporter who stood vigil outside her home overnight to see her off. It's an all-too-familiar story to Koreans. In 2009, former president Roh Moo-hyun was questioned by prosecutors about corruption allegations involving his family. Soon afterward, he jumped from a mountain cliff behind his home, leaving a suicide note that read: \"there are too many people suffering because of me\". ANSWERING CALMLY \n Park apologized - as she has done repeatedly since the scandal broke in October - when she arrived at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. \"I am sorry to the people,\" she told reporters outside. \"I will respond faithfully to the investigation.\" \n At the 10th-floor interrogation room, accompanied by two of her seven lawyers, she declined prosecutors' request to have her testimony videotaped, a senior prosecutor told reporters during a break six hours into questioning. Sometimes not recording the testimony helps a suspect relax and volunteer more information, he said. She answered questions calmly and never invoked her right to refuse to answer questions that could incriminate her, he added. Park has said little publicly about the scandal.  She was ousted from office on March 10 over allegations she conspired with longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to raise millions of dollars for foundations from the country's conglomerates, known as chaebol. Choi and Samsung Group's head, Jay Y. Lee, grandson of the conglomerate's founder, are both on trial in the scandal. \n Park's lawyers say they will argue in her defense that she did not gain personally from the chaebol contributions to the foundations, which prosecutors say were run for the sake of private interests under the control of Choi, and did not pressure business leaders. The 33 prosecutors working on the case will almost certainly file an arrest warrant for Park, said Kim Kyung-soo, a retired prosecutor who interrogated two former military presidents after their arrests in 1995 for treason and bribery. \"Everybody else in the scandal was arrested who had sort of supporting roles,\" Kim said in a telephone interview. \"They are the arms and legs and Park is the main body. It's hard to tell, but it won't be easy not to detain her.\" The team of prosecutors would have been working day and night since the constitutional court decision that ousted her from the presidency on March 10, brainstorming questions and possible answers from her, Kim added. TURBULENT PRESIDENCYThe scandal caps a turbulent presidency and a tragic life for Park, who came to power in the 2012 election under the banner of a conservative party. \n Liberals vilified her as the daughter of military president Park Chung-hee, who took power in a 1961 coup. An older generation of Koreans, who looked upon her father's presidency as the time the economy took off, embraced her.   She was 22 when a North Korean sympathizer killed her mother in an assassination attempt against her father in 1974, making her the de facto first lady. Five years later, Park Chung-hee was assassinated by his intelligence chief. She never married and has maintained a distance from her siblings and personal acquaintances since moving into her childhood home - the presidential Blue House - in 2013. \"I've lived by myself, lonely,\" she said in a tearful public apology in November for the scandal that doomed her presidency. Park's leadership had begun to ebb well before, when she faced public anger over her handling of the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people, mostly school children. A parliamentary panel looking into the influence-peddling scandal last December also probed \"the missing seven hours\" between the first news reports of the ferry disaster and Park's first TV appearance that day. South Korean media reported that a hairdresser from  Toni&Guy in Gangnam, the same salon that did her hair on Tuesday, had spent 90 minutes styling Park's hair during the seven hours. Park's office said the appointment lasted just 20 minutes, during which Park received official briefings.  (Writing by Bill Tarrant)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013   South Korean prosecutors grilled the country's just-ousted president on Tuesday in a long-awaited investigation of corruption allegations that ended her rule and now threaten to put her in jail. \n The questioning of Park Geun-hye came 11 days after the Constitutional Court unanimously ruled to dismiss her over suspicions she colluded with a confidante to extort money from businesses and committed other wrongdoings. Her powers had been suspended since she was impeached by parliament in December. \n \"I am sorry to the people. I will sincerely undergo an investigation,\" Park told reporters, without elaborating, when she arrived at the prosecutors' office. \n It was not clear if Park's brief statement meant she acknowledged the corruption allegations, since she has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing. South Korean politicians embroiled in scandals often offer public apologies for causing trouble though they deny any involvement. \n In Park's questioning, expected to last until late in the evening, prosecutors were trying to determine whether to seek an arrest warrant, according to South Korean media. Many other suspects implicated in the scandal have already been arrested, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, some top government officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. \n Prosecutors have previously accused Park of extortion, bribery and abuse of power, which could theoretically carry penalties of up to life imprisonment. But arresting Park would be a delicate matter because it might aggravate a national divide and create a strong conservative backlash ahead of an election in May to choose her successor, some political experts said. \n Park's scandal has roiled South Korea for months, with those opposing and supporting her rule staging massive rallies. After the March 10 Constitutional Court ruling, Park supporters clashed with police, leaving three dead. On Tuesday, hundreds of Park's supporters waited for hours outside the prosecutors' office, holding anti-impeachment signs and the national flag, which has become a symbol of their protest. \n Park had immunity while in office and had refused to meet with prosecutors or allow officials to search her presidential compound. After leaving office, she has continued to reject the allegations, saying \"I believe the truth will certainly come out.\" \n Park is the first democratically elected leader to be forced out of office in South Korea since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s. \n It was a dramatic fall for Park, the daughter of slain dictator Park Chung-hee who became the country's first female president in late 2012 with the backing of conservatives who remembered her father as a hero who pulled the country up from poverty despite his suppression of civil rights. \n Moon Jae-in, a liberal who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, currently has a commanding lead in opinion surveys for next leader. \n ___ \n Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this story.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013   Several months into their investigation into the country's biggest political scandal in decades, South Korean prosecutors on Tuesday finally met and questioned recently ousted President Park Geun-hye to determine whether to seek a warrant to arrest her. \n Park, who no longer has immunity from prosecution following a March 10 court ruling that ended her presidency, could face multiple charges such as extortion, bribery and abuse of power. The bribery conviction could carry up to life imprisonment. \n A look at the criminal allegations against Park, who has steadfastly denied any legal wrongdoing, and the potential impact her fate could have on South Korean politics: \n ___ \n EXTORTION AND ABUSE OF POWER \n Park is accused of conspiring with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to pressure 16 business groups, including Samsung, to donate 77.4 billion won ($69 million) to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, two nonprofits that Choi controlled. \n According to prosecutors, Park allegedly pushed for company donations through her meetings with the companies' top executives and through her top presidential aides and government officials. \n The companies told investigators that they couldn't refuse because they feared business disadvantages like state tax investigations. \n Park is also suspected of having a senior presidential secretary pressure the Lotte Group into giving an additional 7 billion won ($6 million) to the K-Sports foundation to finance the construction of a sports facility in the city of Hanam, which was to be operated by a private company established by Choi. The money was later returned. \n Park has said she simply asked companies to support projects aimed at promoting the country's culture and sports sectors. \n ___ \n BRIBERY \n Prosecutors accuse Park and Choi of taking bribes from technology giant Samsung, the country's largest business group. \n Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's de facto chief, was arrested last month over allegations that he used 43.3 billion won ($39 million) in corporate funds to bribe Choi for business favors. The money in question includes more than 20 billion won ($18 million) that Samsung donated to the nonprofits Choi controlled. \n Lee allegedly bribed Park and Choi to obtain government backing for a contentious merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 that served as a key step in passing corporate control to Lee from his ailing father. \n Both Park and Lee have denied the allegations. Park told reporters on New Year's Day that she was being \"totally framed.\" \n ___ \n ARTISTS BLACKLISTING AND STATE SECRET LEAKAGE \n Prosecutors also believe Park colluded with Choi and top culture and presidential officials to blacklist thousands of artists deemed as unfriendly to her administration and denied them state support. \n Park's alleged backlist reportedly included some of South Korea's most famous cultural figures, including \"Oldboy\" film director Park Chan-wook and poet Ko Un, whose name frequently appears in discussions for the Nobel literature prize. They had signed joint statements criticizing the government for its handling of a 2014 ferry disaster that killed more than 300 people and supported opposition candidates during major national elections. \n Park has said she never knew about the alleged blacklists. \n Prosecutors also suspect that Park passed to Choi classified presidential documents, including information on ministerial candidates, which further enabled her friend of 40 years to manipulate state affairs from the shadows even though she has never held any official post. \n Park says she only passed drafts of her speeches to Choi for edits but never shared sensitive information to her. \n ___ \n PARK'S FATE \n Prosecutors reportedly said they have \"overflowing\" evidence showing Park is an accomplice in Choi's alleged criminal activities. But pushing to arrest Park is a different matter. \n Some say it's imperative to arrest Park like other key suspects jailed over the scandal, but others worry that placing her behind bars could further deepen a national divide and trigger a conservative backlash ahead of a May 9 election to choose Park's successor. \n After the March 10 court ruling, her loyal conservative supporters held fierce rallies that left three of them dead following clashes with police. If Park is arrested, they will likely stage similar rallies calling for her release, causing a new round of political chaos, according to some political experts. \n Under South Korean law, people convicted of bribery involving more than 100 million won ($89,000) can face a prison term of more than 10 years or even life imprisonment. \n But in the case of Park's bribery allegations, the Samsung bribes went to Choi, not directly to Park. Legal experts say that for the bribery charges to stick, prosecutors must clearly prove that Park and Choi were connected economically and that Samsung provided the money in exchange for \"unjust requests.\" \n ___ \n Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014  Park Geun-hye , the now-former president of  South Korea   who   this month was removed from office  in a historic court ruling, was questioned at a prosecutors\u2019 office on Tuesday in connection with allegations of bribery, extortion and abuse of office.   After what was expected to be a long, grueling interrogation of Ms. Park, which could continue past midnight, prosecutors will decide whether they have enough evidence to ask a court to issue a warrant for her arrest. If she is indicted, she will be the first former South Korean president to face trial since two former military dictators were imprisoned on corruption and mutiny charges in the mid-1990s.   \u201cI am sorry to trouble the people,\u201d Ms. Park told reporters gathered at the entrance of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office. \u201cI will respond faithfully to the investigation.\u201d   Ms. Park, who was accompanied by lawyers, is the first former South Korean president to be questioned by prosecutors since 2009, when former President Roh Moo-hyun testified about corruption allegations involving his family.   Ms. Park\u2019s 10-minute motorcade ride from her home in southern Seoul to the prosecutors\u2019 office was nationally broadcast.   As the motorcade pulled out of her home, hundreds of people lined the alley leading to the two-story red brick house waving South Korean flags and shouting her name. \u201cWe love you!\u201d some yelled as her black sedan passed.   The police formed a cordon to prevent the protesters from spilling onto the road. They had hauled away three people who had lain on the pavement, insisting that they could not let Ms. Park be questioned because she was innocent.   She faces allegations that she conspired with a longtime confidante named  Choi Soon-sil  to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, including more than $38 million in bribes from Samsung. Both Ms. Choi and the top Samsung executive  Lee Jae-yong  have been arrested and indicted on bribery and a host of other criminal charges.   When they indicted Ms. Choi and Mr. Lee, prosecutors  identified Ms. Park  as a criminal accomplice.   On Dec. 9, the National Assembly overwhelmingly  voted to impeach Ms. Park  on charges of corruption and abuse of power. Her presidency was suspended upon the vote. On March 10, the Constitutional Court formally removed her from office by unanimously upholding the parliamentary impeachment.   Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader to be forced out of office in response to popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against his corrupt, authoritarian rule.   Since she took office in early 2013, Ms. Park had been dogged by allegations that Ms. Choi was influencing government affairs from the shadows \u2014 and using her connections with the president for personal gain.   Those long-suppressed allegations \u2014 journalists reporting them had been sued by Ms. Park\u2019s aides \u2014 began shaking her government last fall, when a deluge of what prosecutors considered incriminating evidence began spilling out through local media and disgruntled former associates of Ms. Choi. A huge crowd of people, numbering up to 2 million, rallied in central Seoul every Saturday for months, demanding that she be removed from office.   Ms. Park had repeatedly apologized for the scandal.   But she has vehemently denied any legal wrongdoing, although most South Koreans considered her removal as a key step toward ending what they see as corrupt ties between government and big business, a bane of South Korea\u2019s young democracy.   As president, Ms. Park had also refused to be questioned by prosecutors or testify at the Constitutional Court, calling her impeachment politically biased.   Now that she is an private citizen, she no longer enjoys the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal investigation. Still, she has remained defiant, refusing to accept the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling.   \u201cIt will take time, but I am sure that the truth will be known,\u201d she said on March 12, when she moved out of the presidential Blue House, where she first lived when her father, Park Chung-hee, was the country\u2019s dictator from 1961 to 1979.   She has since holed up in her home, consulting her lawyers ahead of the questioning by prosecutors. Outside, a small but loud group of supporters rallied daily to voice their support for her. Her supporters claim that \u201cpro-North Korean\u201d opposition politicians and media conspired to topple her presidency.   Two former presidents \u2014 the military dictators  Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo  \u2014 were questioned by prosecutors in 1995 on suspicion of bribery. The two men, former army generals, also faced sedition and mutiny charges for their roles in the 1979 military coup that brought them to power and in the 1980 massacre of antigovernment demonstrators in the southwestern city of Kwangju.   Mr. Chun was sentenced to death \u2014 the sentence was later commuted to life in prison \u2014 while Mr. Roh was sentenced to 17 years. Both were pardoned and released in December 1997.   Roh Moo-hyun, who faced prosecutors in 2009, was never indicted; deeply humiliated, he  killed himself  by jumping off a cliff behind his home in southern South Korea a few weeks after he was questioned by prosecutors in Seoul.",

If she is indicted, she will be the first former South Korean president to face trial since two former military dictators were imprisoned on corruption and mutiny charges in the mid-1990s.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"195\" data-total-count=\"873\">\u201cI am sorry to trouble the people,\u201d Ms. Park told reporters gathered at the entrance of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office. \u201cI will respond faithfully to the investigation.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"224\" data-total-count=\"1097\">Ms. Park, who was accompanied by lawyers, is the first former South Korean president to be questioned by prosecutors since 2009, when former President Roh Moo-hyun testified about corruption allegations involving his family.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"124\" data-total-count=\"1221\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Ms. Park\u2019s 10-minute motorcade ride from her home in southern Seoul to the prosecutors\u2019 office was nationally broadcast.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"223\" data-total-count=\"1444\" id=\"story-continues-3\">As the motorcade pulled out of her home, hundreds of people lined the alley leading to the two-story red brick house waving South Korean flags and shouting her name. \u201cWe love you!\u201d some yelled as her black sedan passed.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"228\" data-total-count=\"1672\">The police formed a cordon to prevent the protesters from spilling onto the road. They had hauled away three people who had lain on the pavement, insisting that they could not let Ms. Park be questioned because she was innocent.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"341\" data-total-count=\"2013\">She faces allegations that she conspired with a longtime confidante named <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/world/asia/south%2Dkoreans%2Dashamed%2Dover%2Dles%2Dsecretive%2Dadviser.html?_r=0\">Choi Soon-sil</a> to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, including more than $38 million in bribes from Samsung. Both Ms. Choi and the top Samsung executive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/business/jay-y-lee-samsung-trial.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPark%20Geun-hye&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=16&amp;pgtype=collection\">Lee Jae-yong</a> have been arrested and indicted on bribery and a host of other criminal charges.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"98\" data-total-count=\"2111\" id=\"story-continues-4\">When they indicted Ms. Choi and Mr. Lee, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea-extortion-accomplice-prosecutors.html\">identified Ms. Park</a> as a criminal accomplice.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"289\" data-total-count=\"2400\">On Dec. 9, the National Assembly overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">voted to impeach Ms. Park</a> on charges of corruption and abuse of power. Her presidency was suspended upon the vote. On March 10, the Constitutional Court formally removed her from office by unanimously upholding the parliamentary impeachment.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"247\" data-total-count=\"2647\">Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader to be forced out of office in response to popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against his corrupt, authoritarian rule.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"2857\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Since she took office in early 2013, Ms. Park had been dogged by allegations that Ms. Choi was influencing government affairs from the shadows \u2014 and using her connections with the president for personal gain.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"444\" data-total-count=\"3301\">Those long-suppressed allegations \u2014 journalists reporting them had been sued by Ms. Park\u2019s aides \u2014 began shaking her government last fall, when a deluge of what prosecutors considered incriminating evidence began spilling out through local media and disgruntled former associates of Ms. Choi. A huge crowd of people, numbering up to 2 million, rallied in central Seoul every Saturday for months, demanding that she be removed from office.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"51\" data-total-count=\"3352\">Ms. Park had repeatedly apologized for the scandal.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"240\" data-total-count=\"3592\">But she has vehemently denied any legal wrongdoing, although most South Koreans considered her removal as a key step toward ending what they see as corrupt ties between government and big business, a bane of South Korea\u2019s young democracy.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"155\" data-total-count=\"3747\" id=\"story-continues-6\">As president, Ms. Park had also refused to be questioned by prosecutors or testify at the Constitutional Court, calling her impeachment politically biased.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"213\" data-total-count=\"3960\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Now that she is an private citizen, she no longer enjoys the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal investigation.

Outside, a small but loud group of supporters rallied daily to voice their support for her.

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013   South Korea's just-ousted president said Tuesday she was \"sorry\" to the people as she underwent questioning by prosecutors over a corruption scandal that led to her removal from office. \n The questioning of Park Geun-hye came 11 days after the Constitutional Court ruled unanimously to dismiss her as president over allegations she colluded with a confidante to extort money from businesses and committed other wrongdoings. Her power had been suspended since she was impeached by parliament in December. \n It was a dramatic fall for Park, a daughter of slain dictator Park Chung-hee, who was elected as the country's first female president in late 2012 amid a wave of support from conservatives who remembered her father as a hero who pulled the country up from poverty despite his suppression of civil rights. \n \"I am sorry to the people. I will sincerely undergo an investigation,\" Park said when arrived at a Seoul prosecutors' office. \n She did not elaborate and went inside the building amid a barrage of camera flashes. Prosecutors later said they began questioning Park with her lawyer present. \n It was not clear if Park's brief statement meant she acknowledged the corruption allegations, as she has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing. South Korean politicians embroiled in scandals often offer public apologies for causing trouble though they deny their involvement. \n The questioning of Park was expected to last until late in the evening, and South Korean media reported prosecutors won't likely summon her again after Tuesday's questioning. \n Dozens of high-profile figures including some top Park government officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have already been arrested or indicted in connection with the scandal. \n Park could face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges, but it is not known if prosecutors will seek to arrest her anytime soon, especially ahead of an election in May to choose her successor. \n Some experts say there would be a strong backlash from conservatives if Park were to appear on TV dressed in prison garb and handcuffed. Currently, Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 election to Park, now has a commanding lead in opinion surveys. \n The scandal has roiled and divided South Korea for months, with millions of people taking to the streets and calling for park's ouster in the largest public demonstrations in decades. In recent weeks, pro-Park supporters, mostly elderly conservatives, have staged their own rallies. Three people died in clashes between Park's supporters and the police after the court ruled against her. \n Earlier Tuesday, hundreds of Park supporters waited for hours near her Seoul home, holding national flags and chanting her name as thick lines of police officers separated them from a group of reporters. Stepping out of her home's black metal gate, Park did not address to her supporters before getting into a black sedan, which followed a motorcade of police motorcycles to the prosecution office. \n Park had immunity while in office and had refused to meet with prosecutors or allow officials to search her presidential compound. She has since expressed defiance toward the allegations, saying \"I believe the truth will certainly come out.\" \n The March 10 ruling has made Park South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be forced out of office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s. \n __ \n Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this story.",

Currently, Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 election to Park, now has a commanding lead in opinion surveys.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The scandal has roiled and divided South Korea for months, with millions of people taking to the streets and calling for park's ouster in the largest public demonstrations in decades. In recent weeks, pro-Park supporters, mostly elderly conservatives, have staged their own rallies. Three people died in clashes between Park's supporters and the police after the court ruled against her.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Earlier Tuesday, hundreds of Park supporters waited for hours near her Seoul home, holding national flags and chanting her name as thick lines of police officers separated them from a group of reporters. Stepping out of her home's black metal gate, Park did not address to her supporters before getting into a black sedan, which followed a motorcade of police motorcycles to the prosecution office.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Park had immunity while in office and had refused to meet with prosecutors or allow officials to search her presidential compound.

   "content": "By  Yeganeh Torbati  and  James Pearson \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  The liberal South Korean politician most likely to become the country's next president would, if elected, review how the government would deploy an advanced U.S. missile defense system and would consult China, two of his top advisers said on Friday. If Moon Jae-in, the front-runner for the May 9 presidential election, reverses policy on the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system, it will place him at odds with the United States, South Korea's biggest ally. The conservative government of impeached president Park Geun-hye agreed to deploy the THAAD to guard against an attack by North Korea, but the decision sparked outrage in China, which responded with restrictions on some companies doing business with and in South Korea. China says the system's radar can be used to spy into its territory. Moon would likely \"do a review of the validity of the decision\", said Choi Jong Kun, a professor at Yongsei University and an adviser to Moon on foreign policy. \"While doing it he will consult with the United States, as well as China,\" Choi said in an interview with Reuters.  \"At the end of the day, if the reality unfolds in a way that South Korea's national security and the economy were damaged because of the THAAD, not because of the North Korea issue, then it's not really a rational situation, is it?\" The comments are at variance with a tough stand taken by the new U.S. administration on North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, visiting Seoul for the first time since taking office, said on Friday a U.S. policy of \"strategic patience\" with North Korea has ended and military action would be \"on the table\" if North Korea elevated the threat level to warrant it. Tillerson also said he expected the next South Korean government would \"continue to be supportive\" of the THAAD system. \n China is South Korea's largest trading partner and the dispute over the missile system has left normally bustling shopping districts in the capital, Seoul, devoid of their usual crowds of Chinese tourists.  In China, the row has led to a freeze of South Korean television dramas and music, and product boycotts. Moon, a liberal facing little in the way of a significant conservative challenger, said in a debate this week China should stop the economic retaliation and South Korea had to make diplomatic efforts to assuage Chinese anger. \"It's only right for the THAAD deployment issue to be decided by the next administration,\" Moon told foreign media recently. RAPPROCHEMENT \n \n A 63-year-old human rights lawyer, Moon has said he will extend an olive branch to North Korea if elected and would visit Pyongyang before making a trip to the United States.  Just two North-South summits have been held since the 1950-53 Korean war.     Choi said the decision to deploy the THAAD battery had been made hastily. China's reaction was foreseeable and yet was largely ignored by Park's government, he said. \"We had a strategic partnership with Beijing, until this THAAD issue,\" Choi said. \"Our relationship had been pretty OK and pretty good.\" Kim Ki-Jung, another foreign policy adviser to Moon and professor at Yonsei University, said he had tried to convince U.S. military officials and diplomats in Washington last month that the deployment of the THAAD should be left to the leader who succeeds Park. \n \"We are going to acknowledge that two governments made an agreement ... but the actual process of deployment, that should be given to the next government,\"  he said. Instead, the United States started to deploy the first elements of the system this month, after North Korea fired off four ballistic missiles into the sea off northwest Japan. THAAD's job is to intercept and destroy a ballistic missile in its final phase of flight. Moon has criticized the two former conservative presidents \u2013 Park and her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak - for derailing progress made in inter-Korean relations during previous liberal administrations. He calls for a \"two-step\" approach on North Korea, with talks leading to \"economic unification\" and ultimately \"political and military unification.\" His viewpoints could spark friction with Washington, but Moon would have no problem distancing South Korea's interests from those of the United States, said Kim, the Yonsei University professor. \"The basic assumption is that we are going to maintain the success of our bilateral alliance,\" Kim said.  \"We are going to keep it ... as long as we admit that South Korea is not the 51st state of the United States. We are an independent country, we have our own national interest, and we should have our own foreign policy strategy.\"  (Editing by Robert Birsel and Raju Gopalkrishnan)",

   "content": "By  Robert Birsel \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in South Korea on Friday for the second leg of an Asian tour focused on finding a  \"new approach\" for North Korea after what he described as two decades of failed efforts to denuclearize the reclusive state. Tillerson, a former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience, began his first Asian visit as secretary of state in Japan on Wednesday and travels to China on Saturday. In South Korea, he will visit the heavily fortified border with North Korea, the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), before meeting Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is also acting president. In Tokyo on Thursday, Tillerson said 20 years of diplomatic and other efforts, including a period when the United States provided North Korea with $1.35 billion in assistance \"to take a different pathway\", had come to nothing. \"In the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required. Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,\" he told a news conference, his first as secretary of state. North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches since the beginning of last year. \n Last week, it launched four more ballistic missiles and is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States. Washington has been pressing Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Tillerson is expected to tell the Chinese leadership that the United States intends to increase missile defenses in the region, despite China's opposition, a U.S. official told Reuters in Washington. South Korea, one of the staunchest U.S. allies in Asia, has agreed to deploy a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system in South Korea.  China says the system's radar is a threat to its security. \n ELECTION \n Tillerson faces a delicate task in South Korea, which is in political turmoil after former President Park Geun-hye was ousted last week in a corruption scandal. A presidential election will be held on May 9. A South Korean liberal opposition politician, Moon Jae-in, who has raised questions about the THAAD deployment, is leading in the opinion polls.    \n China resents U.S. pressure to do more on North Korea and says it is doing all it can but will not take steps to threatened the livelihoods of the North Korean people. China has urged North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile tests and said South Korea and the United States should stop joint military exercises and seek talks instead. Chinese state media reiterated on Friday that the main problem was between the United States and North Korea, and denounced what it called the \"throwing of dirty water\" at China on the North Korean issued by Washington and Seoul. \"They seem to have forgotten that the root of the nuclear issue on the peninsula is the deeply ingrained mutual distrust between the United States and North Korea and the long-time, intense confrontation between North and South,\" the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a front-page commentary. Tillerson will also meet commanders of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.   (Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Editing by Lincoln Feast)",

   "content": "Seoul (CNN) Less than 50 days into the job, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has arrived in South Korea facing a  host of issues  that would test even the most seasoned diplomat.    The  impeachment of President Park Geun-hye  one week ago has not only upended domestic politics, it has raised questions over the balance of Washington-Seoul relations at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula.   Tillerson has questioned US policy on North Korea and is working on a new approach after declaring  20 years of previous policies \"have failed.\"   He is due to meet with acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, and is expected to seek assurances that South Korea will continue to honor an agreement to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system,  the first parts of which arrived in South Korea earlier this month .   Next government?    Koreans will go to the polls on May 9  to choose Park's replacement, after which everyone Tillerson meets with may be out of a job. Hwang has already said he won't be contesting his party's leadership.    The upcoming election is expected to result in a swing to the left, likely in favor of the Democratic United Party's Moon Jae-in, who narrowly lost to Park in 2012 and has led opinion polls since her ouster.    Moon's party has been critical of the THAAD agreement and suggested it should be renegotiated, saying Park should have sought the approval of the National Assembly before deployment began.    Their conservative critics, on the other hand, have accused them of seeking to appease North Korea and of being too close to China,  which has adamantly opposed the weapons system .    In a busy election office in downtown Seoul, alongside rooms crammed with staff and computers, Democratic lawmaker Song Young-gil rejected accusations that his party is \"anti-American\" and said South Koreans \"can decide our destiny.\"    \"The United States and President Trump should respect the new democratic government,\" said Song, who is running Moon's campaign for the presidency.    He dismissed concerns over a delay in THAAD's deployment, pointing out the system would not protect much of the country, including the nearly 26 million people living in the Seoul metro area.    \"It's not urgent,\" he said. \"The more urgent critical thing is how we can prevent (North Korean) nuclear testing, the sixth test.\"    'Very dangerous situation'   Conservatives have argued that any shift from the current position on THAAD will be a retreat in the face of pressure from Beijing and Pyongyang.    Kim Young-woo, a conservative lawmaker and chairman of the Korean National Assembly's Defense Commission, told CNN that \"the whole Korean peninsula is facing a very dangerous situation now.\"   He said that if a future government attempted to renegotiate THAAD's deployment \"our alliance (with the US) could be weakened.\"   In the face of Chinese aggression, Kim said the US could consider deploying mobile tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea -- which has been nuclear free since 1991.   Song said Seoul should be able to work with Beijing to \"reduce their concerns,\" adding \"we can seek the third solution between beyond the pro or anti (THAAD).\"   He added that it is Pyongyang that benefits most from the disagreement. \"The chasm between China and (South) Korea and the US, they may enjoy this situation,\" he said.    Eunjung Lim, a Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University, agreed.    \"I don't think THAAD is the reason (for) North Korea's provocations, but they might use this opportunity to estrange South Korea, China, and the US,\" she said.    Time to talk?   While Song's party has been keen to reassure Washington that it is open to discussion on THAAD, opposition to the system and the increased militarization of the Korean peninsula was a key part of protests that helped bring down Park.    \"The decision made by the government to deploy THAAD was not democratic at all,\" said Baek Ga-yoon, coordinator for the Center for Peace and Disarmament, which advocates for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.    She accused acting-President Hwang of taking advantage of the political instability around Park's impeachment to press ahead with THAAD's deployment \"without any agreement from the National Assembly and the villagers of Songju,\" where locals have long protested the system's installation.    Being opposed to THAAD does not mean people are against or even skeptical of the US-South Korean alliance, Baek said, but she warned that current rhetoric over North Korea risked an \"endless arms race.\"    \"It's a vicious circle,\" she said. \"If you deploy THAAD now you're going to later on make an argument to deploy Patriot missiles and then another weapon.\"    Echoing  arguments   by   analysts  -- who point to the failure of sanctions and military build-up to prevent North Korea's nuclear testing -- Baek said she and other civil society activists feel \"the only solution is direct negotiation.\"     \"It may sound very naive, but we already witnessed that a hostile strategy against North Korea (pursued by Park's government) and the US government is not effective at all,\" she said.",

Hwang has already said he won't be contesting his party's leadership. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The upcoming election is expected to result in a swing to the left, likely in favor of the Democratic United Party's Moon Jae-in, who narrowly lost to Park in 2012 and has led opinion polls since her ouster. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Moon's party has been critical of the THAAD agreement and suggested it should be renegotiated, saying Park should have sought the approval of the National Assembly before deployment began. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Their conservative critics, on the other hand, have accused them of seeking to appease North Korea and of being too close to China, <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2017/03/12/asia/south-korea-park-impeachment-china-thaad/index.html\">which has adamantly opposed the weapons system</a>. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In a busy election office in downtown Seoul, alongside rooms crammed with staff and computers, Democratic lawmaker Song Young-gil rejected accusations that his party is \"anti-American\" and said South Koreans \"can decide our destiny.\" </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The United States and President Trump should respect the new democratic government,\" said Song, who is running Moon's campaign for the presidency. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He dismissed concerns over a delay in THAAD's deployment, pointing out the system would not protect much of the country, including the nearly 26 million people living in the Seoul metro area. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's not urgent,\" he said. \"The more urgent critical thing is how we can prevent (North Korean) nuclear testing, the sixth test.\" </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>'Very dangerous situation'</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Conservatives have argued that any shift from the current position on THAAD will be a retreat in the face of pressure from Beijing and Pyongyang. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Kim Young-woo, a conservative lawmaker and chairman of the Korean National Assembly's Defense Commission, told CNN that \"the whole Korean peninsula is facing a very dangerous situation now.\"</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He said that if a future government attempted to renegotiate THAAD's deployment \"our alliance (with the US) could be weakened.\"</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the face of Chinese aggression, Kim said the US could consider deploying mobile tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea -- which has been nuclear free since 1991.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Song said Seoul should be able to work with Beijing to \"reduce their concerns,\" adding \"we can seek the third solution between beyond the pro or anti (THAAD).\"</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He added that it is Pyongyang that benefits most from the disagreement. \"The chasm between China and (South) Korea and the US, they may enjoy this situation,\" he said. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Eunjung Lim, a Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University, agreed. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I don't think THAAD is the reason (for) North Korea's provocations, but they might use this opportunity to estrange South Korea, China, and the US,\" she said. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>Time to talk?</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While Song's party has been keen to reassure Washington that it is open to discussion on THAAD, opposition to the system and the increased militarization of the Korean peninsula was a key part of protests that helped bring down Park. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The decision made by the government to deploy THAAD was not democratic at all,\" said Baek Ga-yoon, coordinator for the Center for Peace and Disarmament, which advocates for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">She accused acting-President Hwang of taking advantage of the political instability around Park's impeachment to press ahead with THAAD's deployment \"without any agreement from the National Assembly and the villagers of Songju,\" where locals have long protested the system's installation. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Being opposed to THAAD does not mean people are against or even skeptical of the US-South Korean alliance, Baek said, but she warned that current rhetoric over North Korea risked an \"endless arms race.\" </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's a vicious circle,\" she said. \"If you deploy THAAD now you're going to later on make an argument to deploy Patriot missiles and then another weapon.\" </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Echoing <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/north-korea-donald-trump-options/\">arguments</a> <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2017/02/15/opinions/what-can-trump-do-north-korea-cathcart-opinion/\">by</a> <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/china-us-north-korea/\">analysts</a> -- who point to the failure of sanctions and military build-up to prevent North Korea's nuclear testing -- Baek said she and other civil society activists feel \"the only solution is direct negotiation.\"  </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It may sound very naive, but we already witnessed that a hostile strategy against North Korea (pursued by Park's government) and the US government is not effective at all,\" she said. </div> <p class=\"zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer\"></p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013   It was hard to imagine that ousted President Park Geun-hye could get any more unpopular in South Korea \u2014 until she moved out of the presidential palace and left her nine dogs behind. \n Just days after being removed from office by the Constitutional Court over a massive corruption scandal, an animal rights group accused Park of animal abandonment for not bringing the dogs with her. \n Park's neighbors had given her a pair of Jindo dogs, a Korean breed of hunting dogs, when she left for the presidential Blue House in 2013. The dogs recently gave birth to seven puppies, which are now considered too young to be separated from their mother, Kim Dong-jo, a Blue House spokesman, said Wednesday. \n Kim said the dogs would continue to stay at the presidential palace until they're ready to be sent to new owners. Park told staff members to take good care of the dogs before vacating the Blue House on Sunday, he said. \n Kim Ae Ra, who heads the Korea Alliance for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the group filed a complaint Monday with South Korea's Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission over Park's dogs. The commission then asked the National Police Agency to look into the matter. Officials from the police agency couldn't immediately confirm how the case would be treated. \n It appears unlikely that Park not taking the dogs with her would qualify as abandonment under South Korea's animal protection law, which defines lost or abandoned animals as those \"wandering without an owner in public places\" or \"left deserted in paper boxes or other containers.\" \n \"It's difficult to say that the dogs were abandoned when it seems they are being taken care of and fed properly, and will likely receive medical attention when they need it,\" said Lee Hyeongchan, a veterinarian-turned-lawyer. \n Animal abandonment is punishable by a fine of up to 1 million won ($873). People who fail to report an ownership change in pets within 30 days can also face fines of up to 500,000 won ($436). \n Park's decision to leave the dogs behind touched off a heated reaction from dog lovers, who flooded social media with angry remarks. \n \"It seems that Park Geun-hye is a person who entirely lacks empathy, whether it's for humans or for animals,\" Park Jeong-eon, a 38-year-old office worker who is unrelated to the ousted president, told The Associated Press. \n Park's two adult dogs also had five puppies in 2015 and the presidential office sent them to civilian owners. \n Parliament passed an impeachment motion against Park in December, and the court formally removed her from office on Friday. Prosecutors plan to question her next week over suspicions that she colluded with a friend to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs.",

The dogs recently gave birth to seven puppies, which are now considered too young to be separated from their mother, Kim Dong-jo, a Blue House spokesman, said Wednesday.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Kim said the dogs would continue to stay at the presidential palace until they're ready to be sent to new owners.

People who fail to report an ownership change in pets within 30 days can also face fines of up to 500,000 won ($436).</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Park's decision to leave the dogs behind touched off a heated reaction from dog lovers, who flooded social media with angry remarks.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>\"It seems that Park Geun-hye is a person who entirely lacks empathy, whether it's for humans or for animals,\" Park Jeong-eon, a 38-year-old office worker who is unrelated to the ousted president, told The Associated Press.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Park's two adult dogs also had five puppies in 2015 and the presidential office sent them to civilian owners.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Parliament passed an impeachment motion against Park in December, and the court formally removed her from office on Friday.

Anywhere from 30 to 70 pastors have been kicked out of the area. \n \u201cChinese authorities raided the homes of the missionaries, citing a problem with their visas, and told them to leave,\u201d a human rights activist told AFP. \n There are 500 registered South Korean missionaries in China, according to Christianity Today; however, the publication notes the real number may be four times as high. \n Word of the arrests marked the latest flashpoint in escalating tensions between China and South Korea, as Rex Tillerson makes his first trip to Asia as Secretary of State. South Korea and Japan have supported U.S. efforts to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea -- and the countries' naval forces conducted missile defense information-sharing drills with the U.S. on Wednesday. \n \n \n \n \n \n But Beijing has raised red flags over the drills, and has claimed the planned deployment of a missile defense system known as THAAD could peer into Chinese territory, weakening its own nuclear defenses. \n Tillerson, who arrived in Tokyo late Wednesday at the start of his four-day, three-nation tour, could provide some reassurance to nervous allies. He's set to meet Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. \n After Tokyo, Tillerson visits South Korea, also caught up in political upheaval after last week's ouster of its president, Park Geun-hye, over a corruption scandal. Park had been in lockstep with Washington's efforts to isolate North Korea. The favorite to succeed her is Moon Jae-in, a moderate who wants to engage North Korea's government. \n Tillerson's final leg involves meetings with several senior Chinese officials in Beijing. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Koreans will go to the polls in May to elect a successor to  Park Geun-hye , whose presidency ended last week in a  historic court ruling , the government announced on Wednesday.   The vote will be May 9, nearly two months after the Constitutional Court decision last Friday, which formally removed Ms. Park from office. The ruling approved the  National Assembly\u2019s December vote  to impeach her.   By law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days of the ruling, and all the major political parties have announced schedules for primary races to select their candidates.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is serving as acting president, announced the date of the election. He also said that he would not run for the job, choosing to focus instead on his role as acting president during the transition period.   Mr. Hwang, an ally of Ms. Park, had been cited as a potential candidate for conservatives in a race in which Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader, has been the consistent front-runner.   South Korea \u2019s conservative camp, which has ruled the country for the last nine years, has been deeply discredited by the scandal engulfing Ms. Park and her former aides. In recent surveys, Mr. Hwang has been the only viable potential conservative candidate, but he has still ranked a distant second in the surveys, or third behind Ahn Hee-jung, a liberal provincial governor.   \u201cI know there are people who want me to run,\u201d Mr. Hwang said on Wednesday. \u201cBut I have concluded that it is not appropriate for me to run and that I should focus on working for the stability of state affairs and the fair management of the presidential election.\u201d   Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader forced from office under popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960.   Also on Wednesday,  prosecutors summoned Ms. Park  for questioning in the scandal.   Although prosecutors have identified Ms. Park as a criminal suspect accused of bribery, extortion and abuse of power in recent months, they could not indict her or even summon her by force while she was president.   But now that she is an ordinary citizen, prosecutors told her to appear for questioning next Tuesday.   Prosecutors said that she conspired with her secretive longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses like Samsung, and that some of the money represented bribes for political favors. Ms. Choi is already under arrest and on trial.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korean prosecutors said Wednesday they plan to question ousted President Park Geun-hye next week about the corruption scandal that removed her from office, as the government announced that an election will be held on May 9 to pick her successor.   Park lost her presidential immunity from prosecution after the Constitutional Court ruled Friday to formally end her rule over allegations that she colluded with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort money from businesses and allowed Choi to pull government strings from the shadows.   Prosecutors said they told Park's lawyer that they'll summon her next Tuesday as a suspect in the scandal. Park's lawyer later said Park would \"faithfully\" undergo the questioning, according to the prosecutors' office.   Dozens of high-profile figures including Choi, some top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have already been indicted in the scandal.   Park could also face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges. She has denied any legal wrongdoing and expressed defiance toward the corruption allegations.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said after leaving the presidential Blue House on Sunday.   Park's comments raised worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following Friday's court ruling.   By law, a national vote to select her successor must be held within two months of Friday's court ruling, and the Ministry of Interior said Wednesday that May 9 would be the election date.   Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, is the favorite in opinion surveys to be the country's next leader.   His campaign received a boost Wednesday when Prime Minister and acting leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, considered the potential leading conservative challenger to Moon, said he won't run.   Hwang told a Cabinet meeting that he has decided to focus on managing state affairs and resolving political and economic uncertainties triggered by Park's ouster until a new president is elected. Hwang would have been forced to resign and let a deputy prime minister serve as another interim leader if he had stood for the election.   South Korean conservatives have been badly hurt by Park's scandal. In early February, former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, also regarded as a conservative candidate, withdrew from consideration amid mounting media speculation about his political competence and corruption allegations.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean prosecutors said Wednesday they plan to question ousted President Park Geun-hye next week over a corruption scandal that removed her from office, as the government announced that an election will be held on May 9 to pick her successor.   Park lost her presidential immunity from prosecution after the Constitutional Court ruled Friday to formally end her rule over allegations that she colluded with a longtime confidante to extort money from businesses and allowed her pull government strings from the shadows.   Prosecutors said they told Park's lawyer that they'll summon her next Tuesday as a suspect in the scandal. Park's lawyer later said Park would \"faithfully\" undergo the questioning, according to a Seoul prosecutors' office.   Dozens of high-profile figures including some top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have already been indicted over the scandal.   Park could also face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges, but she has denied any legal wrongdoing and expressed defiance toward her corruption allegations.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said after leaving the presidential Blue House on Sunday.   Park's comments raised worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following Friday's court ruling.   By law, a national vote to find her successor must be held within two months of Friday's court ruling, and the Ministry of Interior said Wednesday that May 9 would be the election date.   Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, is the favorite to be the country's next leader in opinion surveys.   His campaign got a boost Wednesday when Prime Minister and acting leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, considered the potential leading conservative challenger to Moon, said he won't run.   Hwang told a Cabinet meeting that he decided to focus on managing state affairs and resolving political and economic uncertainties triggered by Park's ouster until a new president is elected. Hwang would have been forced to resign and let a deputy prime minister serve as another interim leader if he had stood for the election.

Park lost her presidential immunity from prosecution after the Constitutional Court ruled Friday to formally end her rule over allegations that she colluded with a longtime confidante to extort money from businesses and allowed her pull government strings from the shadows.   Prosecutors said they told Park's lawyer that they'll summon her next Tuesday as a suspect in the scandal. No further details were provided.   Dozens of high-profile figures including some top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have already been indicted over the scandal.   Park could also face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges, but she has denied any legal wrongdoing and expressed defiance toward her corruption allegations.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said after leaving the presidential Blue House on Sunday.   Park's comments raised worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following Friday's court ruling.   By law, a national vote to find her successor must be held within two months of Friday's court ruling, and the Ministry of Interior said Wednesday that May 9 would be the election date.   Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, is the favorite to be the country's next leader in opinion surveys.",

Park lost her presidential immunity from prosecution after the Constitutional Court ruled Friday to formally end her rule over allegations that she colluded with a longtime confidante to extort money from businesses and allowed her pull government strings from the shadows.   Prosecutors said they told Park's lawyer that they'll summon her next Tuesday as a suspect in the scandal. No further details were provided.   Dozens of high-profile figures including some top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have already been indicted over the scandal.   Park could also face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges, but she has denied any legal wrongdoing and expressed defiance toward her corruption allegations.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said after leaving the presidential Blue House on Sunday.   Park's comments raised worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following Friday's court ruling.   An election to pick Park's successor will be held by May. Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, is the favorite to be the country's next leader in opinion surveys.",

Park lost her presidential immunity from prosecution after the Constitutional Court ruled Friday to formally end her rule over allegations that she colluded with a longtime confidante to extort money from businesses and allowed her pull government strings from the shadows.   Prosecutors said they told Park's lawyer that they'll summon her next Tuesday as a suspect in the scandal. No further details were provided.   Dozens of high-profile figures including some top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong have already been indicted over the scandal.   Park could also face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges, but she has denied any legal wrongdoing and expressed defiance toward her corruption allegations.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said after leaving the presidential Blue House on Sunday.   Park's comments raised worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following Friday's court ruling.   An election to pick Park's successor will be held by May. Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, is the favorite to be the country's next leader in opinion surveys.",

   "content": "The husband of a driver who received a \u00a3100 parking fine after briefly visiting the same retail park twice in the same day says he will go to court before paying up.    Donna Mullin visited Kingswood Retail Park in Hull, East Yorkshire, for a total of just 40 minutes over her two stays but she was given a fixed penalty notice for being there for four hours.   Mrs Mullin believes that the automatic number plate recognition cameras, owned by parking management company G24,  failed to register her coming and going.    Her husband Derek  said they would 'absolutely not be paying the fine', which was bumped from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 when the couple refused to settle.    Mr Mullins said his wife first parked  for just 30 minutes at the park on the morning of February 3 so she could do some shopping. The car park allows motorists to stay for up to two hours for free.   After driving home to the nearby village of Cottingham to have lunch, she returned later and stayed for just ten minutes to do a food shop and visit Matalan.   The couple were horrified to receive a fine in the post on March 10 saying Mrs Mullin had stayed for four hours.    'I got the letter on Friday and wasn't happy,' said Mr Mullin. 'You can see what happened but it is just something they should be made aware of. I hope they will be concerned by this.   'When I got it I was quite shocked. My immediate thought, was what on earth was my wife doing in Kingswood for four hours? Obviously it wasn't true.   'I can see what they want to stop, people just parking up all day and getting the bus in from there, but they still have to check exactly when people leave and come back out.   'But it wasn't even the same part of the car park she used each time.   'We went back at the weekend to check the policy, and you can return to the car park after an hour so that clearly isn't an issue. In total she was probably in the car park for a total of 40 minutes. We're absolutely not paying the fine.'      It's not the first time the car park has been criticised. In 2015, motorist Dave Ledger, 52, was fined \u00a3100 for leaving his car there overnight.   But the cameras had in fact failed to pick up on the vehicle leaving and re-entering the car park over two days.   G24, which describes itself as a 'pioneer' in car park management technology, took over at the site in 2015 and use cameras installed with automatic number plate recognition.   The company has been contacted for comment.   The Daily Mail started a campaign against aggressive parking firms in 2014.    This website revealed the tactics used by firms to coerce hundreds of thousands of drivers into paying inflated charges.   The parking squads issue official-looking \u00a3100 tickets, often to drivers just a few minutes late returning to their cars. Elderly and disabled people have been specifically targeted at hospitals and High Street stores.   Meanwhile, the firms\u2019 founders have become multi-millionaires on the back of motorists\u2019 misery.",

   "content": "By  Stine Jacobsen \n |  COPENHAGEN \n \n COPENHAGEN  The daughter of a central figure in an influence-peddling scandal that triggered the ouster of South Korean President Park Geun-hye is ready to claim political asylum in Denmark as she fears for her safety if she's forced to return home, her lawyer told Reuters. Chung Yoo-ra is the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Park accused of colluding with the former president to pressure businesses to contribute to non-profit foundations. Both Choi and Park have denied wrongdoing. Chung, 21, was arrested by Danish police on Jan. 1 after she was sought by South Korean authorities who want her extradited. \"If all court instances say she should be extradited then it's political asylum,\" Chung's lawyer Peter Martin Blinkenberg said by phone on his way to visit Chung, who is being held in a prison in northern Denmark. Denmark's Public Prosecutor expects to decide by March 22 whether or not to allow Chung's extradition. That decision can be appealed to the district court, and could thereafter go to the high court and even to the supreme court. \n \"Actually, it wasn't something I was going to argue in the beginning, but you can see how they behave in South Korea and that the opposition party has been part of appointing this special prosecutor,\" Blinkenberg said, referring to the option of political asylum.     South Korea's Constitutional Court dismissed Park from office last week, upholding a parliamentary impeachment vote. \"She (Chung) is obviously connected to her mother, and her mother is apparently linked to the (ousted) president... There's no doubt Yoo-ra would return and experience a very large resistance against her person,\" Blinkenberg said. \n In addition to concerns about her safety, he said he feared Chung was being used to get her mother to talk. \"We have the feeling they are not really interested in Yoo-ra, but if they can use her as leverage they would be willing to do that.\" Chung has been accused of criminal interference related to her academic record. South Korean authorities have also been investigating whether Samsung Electronics channeled money to a German firm controlled by Choi to sponsor Chung's equestrian career in return for favors from Choi and Park. \n Jay Y. Lee, the head of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] is on trial in South Korea on bribery, embezzlement and other charges. He has denied all charges. Chung, who won a gold medal in group dressage at the 2014 Asian Games, has denied any wrongdoing. Blinkenberg said he was working with the authorities to see if Chung could be reunited with her infant son, who is in Denmark, until things are decided. \"The wait is bad enough, but what she can't stand is that she is not with her child,\" he said. The South Korean prosecutors office was not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by Stine Jacobsen; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Prosecutors announced plans on Tuesday to question former President  Park Geun-hye  of  South Korea  in a corruption scandal, four days after she was  removed from office  in a historic court ruling.   Ms. Park\u2019s presidency formally ended last Friday, when the Constitutional Court approved the National Assembly\u2019s  vote to impeach her  in December.   She was the first South Korean leader ousted under popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960.   Although prosecutors have  identified Ms. Park as a criminal suspect  accused of bribery, extortion and abuse of power in recent months, they could not indict her or even summon her by force while she was president. But now that she has become an ordinary citizen, prosecutors moved swiftly.   On Tuesday, they said they were formally opening an investigation on her, adding that they would announce, most likely on Wednesday, when they planned to question her.   If she is summoned, she will be the first former South Korean president to be grilled by prosecutors since 2009, when former President Roh Moo-hyun was questioned on corruption allegations involving his family.   Two other former presidents \u2014 the military dictators Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo \u2014 were questioned in 1995 on suspicion of bribery. The two men, former army generals, also faced sedition and mutiny charges for  their roles in the 1979 military coup  that brought them to power and in the 1980 massacre of antigovernment demonstrators in the southwestern city of Kwangju.   Mr. Chun was sentenced to death \u2014 the sentence was later commuted to life in prison \u2014 while Mr. Roh was sentenced to 17 years. (Both were pardoned and released in December 1997.)   Roh Moo-hyun was never indicted; deeply humiliated, he killed himself by  jumping off a cliff  behind his home in southern South Korea a few weeks after he was questioned by prosecutors in Seoul. His funeral brought together a  crowd of supporters  who called the investigation of Mr. Roh a political vendetta from the conservative government then in power.   It has not always been easy to summon a former president.   Mr. Chun did not go to the prosecutors\u2019 office voluntarily. When prosecutors went to apprehend him, his supporters blocked them for hours.   Such a standoff is feared if Ms. Park decides not to cooperate with prosecutors.   As president, she refused to be questioned by prosecutors or testify at the Constitutional Court, calling her impeachment politically biased. After her ouster, she hinted at defiance, refusing to accept the court ruling and instead saying that \u201cthe truth will be known\u201d later.   Since she  returned to her private home  in southern Seoul on Sunday, her supporters have been rallying outside daily, waving national flags.   Ms. Park has denied any wrongdoing in the scandal, which has shaken the political and business elite for months.   Prosecutors said that she conspired with her secretive longtime confidante,  Choi Soon-sil , to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, like Samsung, and that some of the money represented bribes for political favors. Ms. Choi is already under arrest and on trial.",

   "content": "By  Jeongeun Lee \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  A South Korean animal rights group has filed a complaint with police against former president Park Geun-hye for abandoning nine pet dogs in the presidential Blue House after being dismissed from office. The dogs are Jindos, a Korean breed of hunting dog known for their loyalty. Park left the Blue House presidential complex on Sunday, two days after the Constitutional Court dismissed her from office over a corruption scandal involving big business and financial favors. She returned to her private home in the upmarket Gangnam district of the capital, Seoul. \n Some neighbors there had given Park a pair of Jindos in early 2013, when she left for the Blue House. The pair had seven puppies in January this year. The Busan Korea Alliance for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said on its Twitter account it had filed a complaint against Park on a charge of animal abandonment.      \n The Blue House confirmed that Park had left the dogs there but denied they had been abandoned. \"She told Blue House staff to take good care of the dogs and to find good foster homes for the puppies if necessary,\" said a Blue House spokesman, Kim Dong-jo. \n Another animal rights group, Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, said it was willing to care for the animals and find them homes. \"We want to help these dogs so that they won't be adopted thoughtlessly or end up in dog shelters,\u201d the group said in a statement. The Jindos are native to Jindo Island off the southwest coast of the Korean peninsula.  (Reporting by Jeong-eun Lee; Editing by Robert Birsel)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korea's acting leader on Tuesday turned down the resignation offers made by senior advisers to ousted President Park Geun-hye.   The Constitutional Court ruled Friday to formally end the presidency of Park, who was impeached by parliament in December over a huge corruption scandal. Thirteen policy advisers and other officials at the presidential Blue House tendered their resignations to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who serves as government caretaker, on Monday.   But Hwang turned down the resignations to help ensure stability in state affairs, according to Hwang's office.   Hwang's office said those presidential officials have provided policy advice to Hwang since Park's impeachment.   An election to pick Park's successor will be held by May. Moon Jae-in, a liberal opposition leader who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, is the favorite to be the country's next leader in opinion surveys.   Park also lost her presidential immunity from prosecution and will now be investigated over the scandal that has already sent dozens of high profile figures to face criminal trials.   A Seoul prosecution office said Tuesday that it will inform Park on Wednesday of a date to summons her for questioning. It did not elaborate.   Park could face extortion, bribery and other criminal charges, with prosecutors accusing her of colluding with a longtime confidante to extort money from businesses and also allowing the confidante to pull government strings from the shadows.   Park has denied any legal wrongdoing. After leaving the Blue House on Sunday, Park expressed defiance about the corruption allegations. \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" she said.   Park's comments raised worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following Friday's court ruling.",

   "content": "Euny Hong  is the author of  \"The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation is Conquering the World through Pop Culture\"  (Picador 2014) and \" Kept: A Comedy of Sex and Manners \" (Simon & Schuster 2006). The views expressed in this commentary are her own.    (CNN) South Korea's first female president, Park Geun-hye, is now also the nation's first impeached president. The Korean Constitutional Court on Friday  voted unanimously  to remove her from office, and snap elections for a new president will be held within 60 days.    The subsequent media coverage is rife with comparisons between Park and Trump, claiming that the impeachment of the former augurs the same fate for the latter. Social media sentiment is similar, with tweets like \" Your move, America \" and \" Next to go is Trump .\" However, likening Trump to Park demonstrates not just wishful thinking, but a fundamentally incorrect assumption that democracy is the same in every country.   I have no great love for Park, but it's hard not to notice that her impeachment is pretty much based on the Korean people's hurt feelings. She is possibly the first president of any democratic nation to be formally impeached for being embarrassing, stupid and indiscreet, and not for hard evidence of graft, corruption or perjury.   In America, there is no way a president can be impeached for being embarrassing and stupid. In fact, it might be one of the only jobs in the United States where you can't be fired for that sort of thing. And that's probably a good thing; ruling by the people's emotions might work in Korea, but it is not compatible with American democracy.   What Park did/did not do   Bribery scandals circled Park, but never quite touched her directly: The beneficiary of the alleged bribes was not Park herself, but her closest confidante,  Choi Soon-sil , the cult leader's daughter who reportedly  liked to make friends  in male brothels. (Though Korean prosecutors on January 25 indicted Choi for her role in the scandal, she  vociferously maintained  her innocence.)   It was an unlikely friendship: Park is a president's daughter (her father Park Chung-hee served from 1961 until his assassination in 1979); she speaks five languages and has an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. If she had wanted someone to review state secrets, she could have asked Korea's best and brightest or someone who had security clearance or, at the very least, an actual government employee.    Yet Park was sharing classified information with Choi, who had nothing to recommend her except that her father was Choi Tae-min, leader of a shamanistic, pseudo-Christian cult called the Church of Eternal Life. The elder Choi had told Park back in the 1970s, essentially, \"I see dead people.\" He claimed he had  important messages  to relay from Park's deceased mother.    Upon Choi's death, his daughter Choi Soon-sil assumed the role of Park's \"Chief Mental Influencer.\" For an alleged Svengali, though, Choi appears to be surprisingly lacking in charm, which makes their association even more inexplicable to the Korean people.    By US legal standards, Park's impeachment is peculiar in that she was ousted before even being fully investigated. Even the special prosecutors making the case against Park  reportedly claimed   they didn't have time to complete the inquiry and were denied an extension.    However, even if she had been clearly linked to financial malfeasance, this crime would have been secondary to the Korean public. After all, in Korea, it has historically been the case that bribery is synonymous with presidency, and some of her predecessors literally absconded with billions of Korean public funds. None of them was ever impeached, though several were prosecuted after leaving office.    Make no mistake: If there were more digging, it's very possible that a dirty money trail would have led directly and indisputably to Park. But the Korean people and the courts were not interested in waiting. They weren't even that interested in the money trail.    Park's main crime was that she ran one of the world's wealthiest nations based on the advice of a cult brat, who had duped her. Choi touted her closeness to Park to cajole Korea's business elite (including Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong, who was  arrested in February ) to donate money to dubious charities in exchange for implied presidential favors. Though a Korean prosecutor  alleged  that Park had knowledge of this -- and she may well have -- what is significant is that the impeachment was pushed through before the conclusion of the investigation.   Three deaths and 30-odd serious injuries  were reported  as having arisen from post-impeachment protests, but had Park not been impeached, a revolution with far more fatalities would have been inevitable. Her removal was probably the only outcome the Korean people would accept, and the Korean senate and courts knew that.   This does not mean that other democracies can impeach presidents based on annoyance and embarrassment, nor should they. Somewhat like the Catholic Church, democracy could only disseminate by adapting to the customs and history of the nations it entered. One of the chief areas of divergence lies in how a leader is ousted.   Democracy's infinite adaptability   Korean democracy is very different from its American counterpart: The Korean democratic state is young; it was founded in 1948, and it has only been a truly autocrat-free democracy since 1987. That's just 30 years. To play catch-up to Western democratic principles, it could only effect change through dramatic upheavals and revolutions.    Case in point: Korea is in its Sixth Republic, which means there have been six fundamentally redrafted Constitutions in under 70 years. That's a lot of instability. France is in its Fifth Republic, but that's over a much longer period, 226 years (their first Constitution was ratified in 1791).    Getting rid of leaders the civilized way only works in very old democracies. In the United Kingdom, for example, there is no written Constitution at all, but their democracy arguably dates back to the Magna Carta and is thus over eight centuries old. Common Law and precedent has, at least in the modern era, prevented chaos. For example, the UK institution of the \"no-confidence vote\" means there's basically an expectation that a very unpopular leader should do the right thing and step down of his or her own accord.    But you can't rely on that sort of gentleman's agreement elsewhere. It wouldn't work in Korea, because democracy there is too young and the rule of law is even younger. Nor would it work in the United States, which is ruled by its Constitution as no other country is. And what that means for presidential impeachment is that you need proof, proof and more proof of wrongdoing. This is the best possible solution, and those who wish for Korean-style democracy in the United States have no idea how dangerous that would be here.   In short, the answer to the following question, \"Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?\" which  Trump tweeted  in 2014, is \"no.\" Not in the United States, at least. Like it or not, it's the best way to prevent utter, near-apocalyptic chaos.",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own.</q></p> <p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><cite class=\"el-editorial-source\"> (CNN)</cite>South Korea's first female president, Park Geun-hye, is now also the nation's first impeached president. The Korean Constitutional Court on Friday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeachment/index.html\">voted unanimously</a> to remove her from office, and snap elections for a new president will be held within 60 days. </p> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The subsequent media coverage is rife with comparisons between Park and Trump, claiming that the impeachment of the former augurs the same fate for the latter. Social media sentiment is similar, with tweets like \"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/e_alexjung/status/840029173292883970\" target=\"_blank\">Your move, America</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KJM9NY/status/840197405043806209\" target=\"_blank\">Next to go is Trump</a>.\" However, likening Trump to Park demonstrates not just wishful thinking, but a fundamentally incorrect assumption that democracy is the same in every country.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">I have no great love for Park, but it's hard not to notice that her impeachment is pretty much based on the Korean people's hurt feelings. She is possibly the first president of any democratic nation to be formally impeached for being embarrassing, stupid and indiscreet, and not for hard evidence of graft, corruption or perjury.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In America, there is no way a president can be impeached for being embarrassing and stupid. In fact, it might be one of the only jobs in the United States where you can't be fired for that sort of thing. And that's probably a good thing; ruling by the people's emotions might work in Korea, but it is not compatible with American democracy.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>What Park did/did not do</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bribery scandals circled Park, but never quite touched her directly: The beneficiary of the alleged bribes was not Park herself, but her closest confidante, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/asia/south-korea-president-scandal-explained/\">Choi Soon-sil</a>, the cult leader's daughter who reportedly <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/10/116_217091.html\" target=\"_blank\">liked to make friends</a> in male brothels. (Though Korean prosecutors on January 25 indicted Choi for her role in the scandal, she <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/world/woman-at-center-of-south-korean-corruption-scandal-protests-her-innocence/2017/01/25/c465d574-e2ed-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_video.html\" target=\"_blank\">vociferously maintained</a> her innocence.)</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It was an unlikely friendship: Park is a president's daughter (her father Park Chung-hee served from 1961 until his assassination in 1979); she speaks five languages and has an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. If she had wanted someone to review state secrets, she could have asked Korea's best and brightest or someone who had security clearance or, at the very least, an actual government employee. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Yet Park was sharing classified information with Choi, who had nothing to recommend her except that her father was Choi Tae-min, leader of a shamanistic, pseudo-Christian cult called the Church of Eternal Life. The elder Choi had told Park back in the 1970s, essentially, \"I see dead people.\" He claimed he had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/03/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-south-koreas-extraordinary-presidential-scandal/?utm_term=.a0abf4c198dd\" target=\"_blank\">important messages</a> to relay from Park's deceased mother. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Upon Choi's death, his daughter Choi Soon-sil assumed the role of Park's \"Chief Mental Influencer.\" For an alleged Svengali, though, Choi appears to be surprisingly lacking in charm, which makes their association even more inexplicable to the Korean people. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By US legal standards, Park's impeachment is peculiar in that she was ousted before even being fully investigated. Even the special prosecutors making the case against Park <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/south-korean-prosecutors-say-president-colluded-in-corruption-scandal/2017/03/06/3bb618f2-df75-4348-bde5-8542af2df74f_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.6e11227ccece\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly claimed</a>  they didn't have time to complete the inquiry and were denied an extension. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">However, even if she had been clearly linked to financial malfeasance, this crime would have been secondary to the Korean public. After all, in Korea, it has historically been the case that bribery is synonymous with presidency, and some of her predecessors literally absconded with billions of Korean public funds. None of them was ever impeached, though several were prosecuted after leaving office. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Make no mistake: If there were more digging, it's very possible that a dirty money trail would have led directly and indisputably to Park. But the Korean people and the courts were not interested in waiting. They weren't even that interested in the money trail. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Park's main crime was that she ran one of the world's wealthiest nations based on the advice of a cult brat, who had duped her. Choi touted her closeness to Park to cajole Korea's business elite (including Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong, who was <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/16/technology/samsung-jay-lee-arrest-warrant/\">arrested in February</a>) to donate money to dubious charities in exchange for implied presidential favors. Though a Korean prosecutor <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/06/skorea-special-prosecutor-president-park-colluded-with-friend-to-receive-samsung-bribe.html\" target=\"_blank\">alleged</a> that Park had knowledge of this -- and she may well have -- what is significant is that the impeachment was pushed through before the conclusion of the investigation.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Three deaths and 30-odd serious injuries <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeachment/\">were reported</a> as having arisen from post-impeachment protests, but had Park not been impeached, a revolution with far more fatalities would have been inevitable. Her removal was probably the only outcome the Korean people would accept, and the Korean senate and courts knew that.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This does not mean that other democracies can impeach presidents based on annoyance and embarrassment, nor should they. Somewhat like the Catholic Church, democracy could only disseminate by adapting to the customs and history of the nations it entered. One of the chief areas of divergence lies in how a leader is ousted.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>Democracy's infinite adaptability</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Korean democracy is very different from its American counterpart: The Korean democratic state is young; it was founded in 1948, and it has only been a truly autocrat-free democracy since 1987. That's just 30 years. To play catch-up to Western democratic principles, it could only effect change through dramatic upheavals and revolutions. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Case in point: Korea is in its Sixth Republic, which means there have been six fundamentally redrafted Constitutions in under 70 years. That's a lot of instability. France is in its Fifth Republic, but that's over a much longer period, 226 years (their first Constitution was ratified in 1791). </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Getting rid of leaders the civilized way only works in very old democracies. In the United Kingdom, for example, there is no written Constitution at all, but their democracy arguably dates back to the Magna Carta and is thus over eight centuries old. Common Law and precedent has, at least in the modern era, prevented chaos. For example, the UK institution of the \"no-confidence vote\" means there's basically an expectation that a very unpopular leader should do the right thing and step down of his or her own accord. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But you can't rely on that sort of gentleman's agreement elsewhere. It wouldn't work in Korea, because democracy there is too young and the rule of law is even younger. Nor would it work in the United States, which is ruled by its Constitution as no other country is. And what that means for presidential impeachment is that you need proof, proof and more proof of wrongdoing. This is the best possible solution, and those who wish for Korean-style democracy in the United States have no idea how dangerous that would be here.</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In short, the answer to the following question, \"Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?\" which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/474134260149157888?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Trump tweeted</a> in 2014, is \"no.\" Not in the United States, at least. Like it or not, it's the best way to prevent utter, near-apocalyptic chaos.</div> <p class=\"zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer\"></p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013   The senior advisers to ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye offered to resign on Monday, news reports said, three days after the country's Constitutional Court formally ended her rule over a corruption scandal. \n Park, whose power had been suspended in a parliamentary impeachment vote in December, was formally removed from office Friday after the court dismissed her from the top post. Park vacated the presidential office on Sunday. \n Nine senior presidential advisers tendered their resignations to acting leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unidentified government officials. Other South Korean media carried a similar report. \n Hwang's office could not immediately confirm the report, and calls to the presidential Blue House weren't answered. \n Park's Blue House had 10 main presidential advisers on foreign policy, economy and other issues, but one position has been vacant since the arrest of one adviser over the scandal. \n After being removed from office, Park has lost her presidential immunity and will likely face a direct investigation over allegations she colluded with a longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to extort money from businesses and allow Choi to meddle in state affairs though she has never held an official post. \n Dozens of high-profile figures, including Choi, Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong and top government officials are already facing criminal trials. \n Park has expressed defiance about the corruption allegations, raising worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following the court's ruling. \n \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said in a statement read by her former presidential spokesman, as hundreds of her supporters chanted her name and waved national flags. \n She had previously apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but denied any legal wrongdoing. \n South Korea's main opposition party has called Park's statement \"shocking\" and \"very regrettable\" because she did not express remorse. \n Park's departure from the Blue House came a day after tens of thousands of opponents and supporters divided the streets of downtown Seoul with massive rallies, reflecting the deep split in the nation. \n South Korea now has to elect a president by early May. Opinion polls show the Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.",

   "content": "min Park \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  Ousted South Korean leader Park Geun-hye faced criticism on Monday over a defiant vow that the truth of her impeachment would be revealed, with the main opposition party urging prosecutors to investigate her quickly. The Constitutional Court dismissed Park from office on Friday when it upheld a parliamentary impeachment vote over an influence-peddling scandal that has shaken the political and business elite. Park has denied any wrongdoing. On Sunday evening, Park left the Blue House presidential palace in Seoul to return to her private home in the city as an ordinary citizen, stripped of her presidential immunity that has shielded her from prosecution. \"Even at the moment she left, she refused to say a word to repent in front of the people, but said such and such about truth and declared nothing but disobedience,\" Choo Mi-ae, head of the biggest opposition party, the Democratic Party, told a meeting on Monday. Park has not commented publicly since the Friday court ruling, but a spokesman read out a statement from her after she returned to her home in the upmarket Gangnam district, in which she expressed regret at not being able to complete her term. \"It will take time, but I believe the truth will be revealed,\" Park said through the spokesman. Many South Koreans have interpreted that as a protest against the Constitutional Court's ruling against her. \n \"It was very shocking and regrettable,\" said Yoo Seong-min, a presidential candidate from the small, right-wing Bareun Party. \"Protesting the constitutional court's decision is a betrayal of the people and betrayal of the constitution.\"  'SWIFT AND THOROUGH' \n Choo said Park should be treated as a suspect and cooperate with any investigation. \n \"Prosecutors must find the truth and punish any crime through their swift and thorough investigation,\" Choo said. Prosecutors accused Park of colluding with a friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure big businesses into contributing to foundations set up to support her policy and allowing her to exert influence on state affairs. Park and Choi both denied wrongdoing and Park declined to answer prosecutors' questions. \n Park, 65, is South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be forced from office.  A snap presidential election will be held by May 9. Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party is favorite in opinion polls. Park's dismissal followed months of political paralysis and turmoil over the scandal that also landed the head of the Samsung conglomerate in jail and facing trial. The crisis has coincided with rising tension with North Korea and anger from China over the deployment in South Korea of a U.S. missile-defense system. Parliament set up team of special prosecutors to investigate the scandal but its mandate has run out and the case has been handed over to regular state prosecutors. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office was not available for comment but media reported that prosecutors were considering summoning Park as early as this week.     (Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Robert Birsel and Michael Perry)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 The senior advisers to ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye offered to resign on Monday, news reports said, three days after the country's Constitutional Court formally ended her rule over a corruption scandal.   Park, whose power had been suspended in a parliamentary impeachment vote in December, was formally removed from office Friday after the court dismissed her from the top post. Park vacated the presidential office on Sunday.   Nine senior presidential advisers tendered their resignations to acting leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unidentified government officials.  Other South Korean media carried a similar report.   Hwang's office could not immediately confirm the report, and calls to the presidential Blue House weren't answered.   Park's Blue House had 10 main presidential advisers on foreign policy, economy and other issues, but one position has been vacant since the arrest of one adviser over the scandal.   After being removed from office, Park has lost her presidential immunity and will likely face a direct investigation over allegations she colluded with a longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to extort money from businesses and allow Choi to meddle in state affairs though she has never held an official post.   Dozens of high-profile figures, including Choi, Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong and top government officials are already facing criminal trials.   Park has expressed defiance about the corruption allegations, raising worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following the court's ruling.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said in a statement read by her former presidential spokesman, as hundreds of her supporters chanted her name and waved national flags.   She had previously apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but denied any legal wrongdoing.   South Korea's main opposition party has called Park's statement \"shocking\" and \"very regrettable\" because she did not express remorse.   Park's departure from the Blue House came a day after tens of thousands of opponents and supporters divided the streets of downtown Seoul with massive rallies, reflecting the deep split in the nation.   South Korea now has to elect a president by early May. Opinion polls show the Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The senior advisers to ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye offered to resign on Monday, news reports said, three days after the country's Constitutional Court formally ended her rule over a corruption scandal.   Park, whose power had been suspended in a parliamentary impeachment vote in December, was formally removed from office Friday after the court dismissed her from the top post. Park vacated the presidential office on Sunday.   Nine senior presidential advisers tendered their resignations to acting leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unidentified government officials.  Other South Korean media carried a similar report.   Hwang's office could not immediately confirm the report, and calls to the presidential Blue House weren't answered.   Park's Blue House had 10 main presidential advisers on foreign policy, economy and other issues, but one position has been vacant since the arrest of one adviser over the scandal.   After being removed from office, Park has lost her presidential immunity and will likely face a direct investigation over allegations she colluded with a longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to extort money from businesses and allow Choi to meddle in state affairs though she has never held an official post.   Dozens of high-profile figures, including Choi, Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong and top government officials are already facing criminal trials.   Park has expressed defiance about the corruption allegations, raising worries about a further deepening of the national divide over her fate. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following the court's ruling.   \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out,\" Park said in a statement read by her former presidential spokesman, as hundreds of her supporters chanted her name and waved national flags.   She had previously apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but denied any legal wrongdoing.   South Korea's main opposition party has called Park's statement \"shocking\" and \"very regrettable\" because she did not express remorse.   Park's departure from the Blue House came a day after tens of thousands of opponents and supporters divided the streets of downtown Seoul with massive rallies, reflecting the deep split in the nation.   South Korea now has to elect a president by early May. Opinion polls show the Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

   "content": "CHICAGO \u2014 Despite the bitter wind, Kim Wasserman showed me around La Villita Park. Occupying 21 acres in the middle of this city\u2019s largest Mexican-American neighborhood, called Little Village, the park used to be a brownfield and illegal dump. Back then, the site leached toxins into hundreds of nearby basements. Sickened residents protested for years. The federal cleanup, finally completed in 2012, became the largest urban  Superfund  project in America.   Ms. Wasserman, executive director of the  Little Village Environmental Justice Organization , then helped lobby the city for the park.   She pointed out where residents got the playground, ball fields, skate park and community gardens they wanted. The $19 million park now hosts city-sponsored sports programs and free concerts. During warm months, Ms. Wasserman said, formerly incarcerated young residents from Little Village help keep an eye on La Villita, discouraging gangs from moving in. \u201cThe community feels ownership of the place,\u201d she said.   One result in this city known for its murder rate: next to no violent crime in the park, according to Ms. Wasserman.   Chicago is at the forefront of a growing, big-city trend. It has been undertaking a major parks and open space program, upgrading neighborhood playgrounds and recreation centers, scooping up acres of disused land for new green areas and repurposing large swaths of formerly industrial waterfront. Aided by a longstanding tax that goes directly to parks, these efforts to improve public space, begun under the city\u2019s former mayor, Richard M. Daley, have gathered steam since  Rahm Emanuel  took office in 2011.   They have met with some of the usual resistance from state authorities reluctant to finance city improvements and from some aldermen who want money now allocated for parks, trees and after-school programs redirected toward violence-prevention. The mayor has testily noted that after-school programs and parks, like La Villita, provide exactly the sort of safe spaces for young people that help reduce crime.   From Philadelphia to Seattle, other American cities are also banking on parks and public spaces to drive social and economic progress. Parks may not seem particularly urgent compared with the latest gangland murder epidemic; but the effort in Chicago to improve and expand them has, neighborhood by neighborhood, delivered long-term rewards. A few downtown showpieces, like the urbane Riverwalk and glamorous Millennium Park, have reaped immense financial windfalls for the city. Barack Obama\u2019s presidential library in Jackson Park promises to become a major new attraction and help rejuvenate that part of the South Side.   Other park projects are not making headlines but are making a difference. I caught up with Mayor Emanuel one afternoon at an arts and recreation center in Ellis Park in Bronzeville, one of the city\u2019s historic African-American neighborhoods. The center, on former Chicago Housing Authority land, is a sunny, brightly colored two-story building with big windows and a state-of-the-art indoor pool. It\u2019s linked with a network of related improvements to transit, public health and street life in Bronzeville. Like La Villita, it was among various long-percolating community-initiated dreams, realized only lately, thanks to a cocktail of financing the mayor helped mix.   \u201cUrban policy often focuses too much just on housing,\u201d Mr. Emanuel told me, grateful to focus on what has become a central plank of his administration and not talk policing or murder rates. \u201cHousing alone doesn\u2019t make a neighborhood.\u201d   That\u2019s a view shared by Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia, who was swept into office last year on a platform committing hundreds of millions of dollars to fixing up some 400 dilapidated green spaces, ball fields, pools, libraries and recreation centers in underserved districts. Philadelphia has the highest poverty rate among the 10 most-populated cities in the United States. The plan focuses on the city\u2019s neediest areas.   Hunting Park, in North Philadelphia, is an example. For years, it was a troubled place before its revitalization started in 2009. Since then, crime has plummeted 89 percent, probably not all thanks to improvements to the park, though Philadelphia authorities attribute declines in prostitution and drug dealing to families taking over the park.   I spent an afternoon with the city\u2019s parks commissioner, Kathryn Ott Lovell, touring crumbling libraries and rec centers in North and West Philadelphia now scheduled for makeovers. Once great buildings, still bustling with children, they remain critical to their neighborhoods, barely held together today by bubble gum and underpaid, overworked custodians who are among the city\u2019s unsung heroes. Changing demographics, new technologies and evolving demands by residents on parks and libraries to be complex community hubs require that these places receive more than just a fresh lick of paint or sod.   They need extensive rethinking. The William Penn Foundation in Philadelphia has pitched in an additional $100 million to help make all that happen, its biggest grant ever.   \u201cWe want every Philadelphian to be able to walk to a place that says, \u2018You are worth it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lovell explained.   Chicago is trying to send the same message. East of Little Village, in the Bridgeport neighborhood, Studio Gang, the highly regarded architecture firm, has designed an elegant new zinc-clad public boathouse, with clerestory windows and a jagged roofline (based on stop-action photographs of rowers, the architects say), providing a gateway from Bridgeport to the waterfront. Farther north, the 606, Chicago\u2019s version of the High Line, which opened in mid-2015, has turned a defunct rail corridor into a wildly popular pedestrian greenway.   And to the south, near Lake Calumet, in an area of shuttered mills where Chicago approaches wilderness, Big Marsh has lately opened as a public bike park and nature preserve carved from nearly 200 acres. I drove to Big Marsh with Michael P. Kelly, the chief executive of the Chicago Park District, who envisioned it becoming \u201ca major new attraction\u201d for cyclists, then took me to a housing project called Altgeld Gardens Homes in far southeast Chicago.   There, the city has installed playground equipment and spruced up parts of Altgeld Gardens\u2019 decrepit 1920\u2019s-era rec center, including an indoor swimming pool. At the center, Mr. Kelly introduced Brian Bradley, the park district\u2019s supervisor for Altgeld Gardens, a huge, quiet man who, in his spare time, teaches young residents how to box.   \u201cThis is a community that fights hard,\u201d Mr. Bradley told me. We were standing beside the heated pool, a magnet for older residents and children, with a view onto the playground. \u201cPlaces like this are where everybody comes together,\u201d he said.   Mr. Bradley recalled growing up in a different neighborhood, whose park and rec center became his salvation and second home. He paused.   Tears suddenly welled in his eyes, and he apologized. The Altgeld Gardens rec center still needed repairs. But the park district\u2019s improvements so far have sent a message: \u201cGrowing up in a place like this you can feel nobody cares,\u201d he said.   \u201cThese changes tell people they\u2019re not forgotten.\u201d",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"460\" data-total-count=\"460\" id=\"story-continues-1\">CHICAGO \u2014 Despite the bitter wind, Kim Wasserman showed me around La Villita Park. Occupying 21 acres in the middle of this city\u2019s largest Mexican-American neighborhood, called Little Village, the park used to be a brownfield and illegal dump. Back then, the site leached toxins into hundreds of nearby basements. Sickened residents protested for years. The federal cleanup, finally completed in 2012, became the largest urban <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/superfund/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about the Superfund program.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Superfund</a> project in America.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"132\" data-total-count=\"592\">Ms. Wasserman, executive director of the <a href=\"http://lvejo.org/\">Little Village Environmental Justice Organization</a>, then helped lobby the city for the park.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"416\" data-total-count=\"1008\">She pointed out where residents got the playground, ball fields, skate park and community gardens they wanted. The $19 million park now hosts city-sponsored sports programs and free concerts. During warm months, Ms. Wasserman said, formerly incarcerated young residents from Little Village help keep an eye on La Villita, discouraging gangs from moving in. \u201cThe community feels ownership of the place,\u201d she said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"116\" data-total-count=\"1124\">One result in this city known for its murder rate: next to no violent crime in the park, according to Ms. Wasserman.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"509\" data-total-count=\"1633\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Chicago is at the forefront of a growing, big-city trend. It has been undertaking a major parks and open space program, upgrading neighborhood playgrounds and recreation centers, scooping up acres of disused land for new green areas and repurposing large swaths of formerly industrial waterfront. Aided by a longstanding tax that goes directly to parks, these efforts to improve public space, begun under the city\u2019s former mayor, Richard M. Daley, have gathered steam since <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/rahm_emanuel/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Rahm Emanuel.\" class=\"meta-per\">Rahm Emanuel</a> took office in 2011.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"407\" data-total-count=\"2040\">They have met with some of the usual resistance from state authorities reluctant to finance city improvements and from some aldermen who want money now allocated for parks, trees and after-school programs redirected toward violence-prevention. The mayor has testily noted that after-school programs and parks, like La Villita, provide exactly the sort of safe spaces for young people that help reduce crime.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"624\" data-total-count=\"2664\">From Philadelphia to Seattle, other American cities are also banking on parks and public spaces to drive social and economic progress. Parks may not seem particularly urgent compared with the latest gangland murder epidemic; but the effort in Chicago to improve and expand them has, neighborhood by neighborhood, delivered long-term rewards. A few downtown showpieces, like the urbane Riverwalk and glamorous Millennium Park, have reaped immense financial windfalls for the city. Barack Obama\u2019s presidential library in Jackson Park promises to become a major new attraction and help rejuvenate that part of the South Side.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"669\" data-total-count=\"3333\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Other park projects are not making headlines but are making a difference. I caught up with Mayor Emanuel one afternoon at an arts and recreation center in Ellis Park in Bronzeville, one of the city\u2019s historic African-American neighborhoods. The center, on former Chicago Housing Authority land, is a sunny, brightly colored two-story building with big windows and a state-of-the-art indoor pool. It\u2019s linked with a network of related improvements to transit, public health and street life in Bronzeville. Like La Villita, it was among various long-percolating community-initiated dreams, realized only lately, thanks to a cocktail of financing the mayor helped mix.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"244\" data-total-count=\"3577\" id=\"story-continues-5\">\u201cUrban policy often focuses too much just on housing,\u201d Mr. Emanuel told me, grateful to focus on what has become a central plank of his administration and not talk policing or murder rates. \u201cHousing alone doesn\u2019t make a neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"427\" data-total-count=\"4004\">That\u2019s a view shared by Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia, who was swept into office last year on a platform committing hundreds of millions of dollars to fixing up some 400 dilapidated green spaces, ball fields, pools, libraries and recreation centers in underserved districts. Philadelphia has the highest poverty rate among the 10 most-populated cities in the United States. The plan focuses on the city\u2019s neediest areas.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"344\" data-total-count=\"4348\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Hunting Park, in North Philadelphia, is an example. For years, it was a troubled place before its revitalization started in 2009. Since then, crime has plummeted 89 percent, probably not all thanks to improvements to the park, though Philadelphia authorities attribute declines in prostitution and drug dealing to families taking over the park.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"604\" data-total-count=\"4952\">I spent an afternoon with the city\u2019s parks commissioner, Kathryn Ott Lovell, touring crumbling libraries and rec centers in North and West Philadelphia now scheduled for makeovers. Once great buildings, still bustling with children, they remain critical to their neighborhoods, barely held together today by bubble gum and underpaid, overworked custodians who are among the city\u2019s unsung heroes. Changing demographics, new technologies and evolving demands by residents on parks and libraries to be complex community hubs require that these places receive more than just a fresh lick of paint or sod.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"171\" data-total-count=\"5123\" id=\"story-continues-8\">They need extensive rethinking. The William Penn Foundation in Philadelphia has pitched in an additional $100 million to help make all that happen, its biggest grant ever.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"120\" data-total-count=\"5243\">\u201cWe want every Philadelphian to be able to walk to a place that says, \u2018You are worth it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lovell explained.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"540\" data-total-count=\"5783\" id=\"story-continues-9\">Chicago is trying to send the same message. East of Little Village, in the Bridgeport neighborhood, Studio Gang, the highly regarded architecture firm, has designed an elegant new zinc-clad public boathouse, with clerestory windows and a jagged roofline (based on stop-action photographs of rowers, the architects say), providing a gateway from Bridgeport to the waterfront. Farther north, the 606, Chicago\u2019s version of the High Line, which opened in mid-2015, has turned a defunct rail corridor into a wildly popular pedestrian greenway.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"456\" data-total-count=\"6239\">And to the south, near Lake Calumet, in an area of shuttered mills where Chicago approaches wilderness, Big Marsh has lately opened as a public bike park and nature preserve carved from nearly 200 acres. I drove to Big Marsh with Michael P. Kelly, the chief executive of the Chicago Park District, who envisioned it becoming \u201ca major new attraction\u201d for cyclists, then took me to a housing project called Altgeld Gardens Homes in far southeast Chicago.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"345\" data-total-count=\"6584\" id=\"story-continues-10\">There, the city has installed playground equipment and spruced up parts of Altgeld Gardens\u2019 decrepit 1920\u2019s-era rec center, including an indoor swimming pool. At the center, Mr. Kelly introduced Brian Bradley, the park district\u2019s supervisor for Altgeld Gardens, a huge, quiet man who, in his spare time, teaches young residents how to box.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"249\" data-total-count=\"6833\">\u201cThis is a community that fights hard,\u201d Mr. Bradley told me. We were standing beside the heated pool, a magnet for older residents and children, with a view onto the playground. \u201cPlaces like this are where everybody comes together,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"135\" data-total-count=\"6968\">Mr. Bradley recalled growing up in a different neighborhood, whose park and rec center became his salvation and second home. He paused.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"247\" data-total-count=\"7215\">Tears suddenly welled in his eyes, and he apologized. The Altgeld Gardens rec center still needed repairs. But the park district\u2019s improvements so far have sent a message: \u201cGrowing up in a place like this you can feel nobody cares,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"56\" data-total-count=\"7271\">\u201cThese changes tell people they\u2019re not forgotten.\u201d</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For months, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have gathered almost weekly near the presidential Blue House in Seoul, calling for the departure of  Park Geun-hye  as  South Korea \u2019s leader.   On Sunday,  t wo days after the Constitutional Court removed her from office  on charges of corruption and abuse of power, they got their wish, as Ms. Park left quietly in a motorcade that whisked her to her two-story red brick house in the southern part of the capital.   Ms. Park became the first South Korean leader to be forced out of office in response to popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against his corrupt, authoritarian rule.   \u201cI am sorry that I could not finish the presidential duty that was entrusted to me,\u201d Ms. Park said in a brief statement read by one of her former aides to reporters outside her home. \u201cI will bear with me all the consequences.\u201d   Ms. Park, who has been pressured by the opposition to publicly accept the court\u2019s ruling and whose own party said it \u201chumbly respected\u201d the decision, hinted that she disagreed with it. \u201cIt will take time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I am sure that the truth will be known.\u201d   As the motorcade carrying Ms. Park arrived at the house where she lived from 1990 to 2013, it pulled past hundreds of supporters lining the alley and waving national flags.   Ms. Park, who has now lost the privilege of immunity that came with the presidency, stepped out of the car, smiled and shook hands with former aides and party lawmakers who waited for her in front of her house.   Supporters said they could not accept the Constitutional Court ruling, and held up a variety of signs to express that sentiment: \u201cYou are our president forever!\u201d \u201cWe love you,\u201d and \u201cPark Geun-hye, the president of the people, welcome back!\u201d   After the court announced its decision on Friday, the flag showing two phoenixes, the presidential symbol of South Korea, was lowered from a Blue House flagpole, but despite the huge significance of her removal from office, Ms. Park could not immediately move out for a prosaic reason.   Ms. Park\u2019s private home in southern Seoul, which has been unoccupied for the past four years, needed repair. In the past couple of days, workers have been busy fixing its broken boiler, installing new furniture and redecorating rooms.   After the ruling was announced on Friday,  thousands of Park supporters, mostly older conservatives, tried to march on the courthouse  and called for its destruction, with some clashing with police officers who blocked them with a barricade of buses.   Three men, in their 60s and 70s, died during the clashes. One of the men died after a steel police speaker fell on his head, and a protester has been arrested on charges of stealing a police bus and ramming it into another, causing the speaker to fall.   On Saturday,  Park supporters  rallied in central Seoul, vowing to start a political party to fight \u201cpro-North Korea\u201d leftists who they said conspired to bring down Ms. Park and calling the Constitutional Court ruling \u201csedition.\u201d No violence was reported.   Later, as dusk fell on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans gathered in central Seoul to celebrate Ms. Park\u2019s ouster, dancing to the Queen song \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d and releasing firecrackers. They regard her removal as a key step toward ending what they see as corrupt ties between government and business that have hindered the country for decades.   Ms. Park\u2019s opponents   organized huge candlelight rallies week after week , for months, forcing prosecutors to investigate  allegations that Ms. Park conspired with her secretive confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to extort millions of dollars  from big businesses. Many protesters held signs on Saturday that said: \u201cNow, the next step is to arrest Park Geun-hye!\u201d   A reinvigorated news media also helped precipitate Ms. Park\u2019s downfall by exposing incriminating details, like a tablet computer belonging to Ms. Choi that proved her influence in state affairs.   As Ms. Park\u2019s approval ratings plummeted, the usually sympathetic conservative news media also turned against her, leaving her with few allies beyond right-wing bloggers and some old conservatives who believed that Ms. Park had been framed and that her downfall would bring about a pro-North Korean leftist government.   The National Assembly voted to  impeach Ms. Park on Dec. 9 , asking the Constitutional Court to formally unseat her. Because she was ousted through impeachment, she lost the privileges the government provides to a former president \u2014 including a $10,500 monthly pension payment, an office, a small staff of aides and free medical service \u2014 but she will receive police protection.   Now an ordinary citizen, Ms. Park is likely to be the subject of a criminal investigation into whether she engaged in corruption. Prosecutors have said she conspired with Ms. Choi to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, like Samsung, and that some of the money represented bribes for political favors.   When prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi and  Lee Jae-yong , the de facto head of Samsung, on bribery and other charges, the prosecutors formally identified Ms. Park as a criminal accomplice. But they could not bring charges against her because she was protected from indictment while in office.   Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who leads the race to replace Ms. Park, criticized her on Sunday for failing to announce in public that she accepts the court ruling.   Speaking at a news conference, he also said prosecutors should open their corruption investigation into Ms. Park immediately, and warned that she should not remove any potential evidence while moving out of the Blue House.   Ms. Park has blocked prosecutors from searching her office. When the Constitutional Court ruled against her, it criticized Ms. Park for failing to cooperate with investigators, for trying to hide her wrongdoings, and for impeding the National Assembly\u2019s and the media\u2019s right to know.   When Ms. Park was elected as president in late 2012, it marked a triumphant return to the Blue House, where she lived from 1961, when her father, Maj. Gen. Park Chung-hee, seized power in a military coup, until 1979, when he was assassinated.   Now, Ms. Park has left it again \u2014 almost certainly for the final time \u2014 disgraced, deeply unpopular and as a criminal suspect.",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"214\" data-total-count=\"214\">SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For months, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have gathered almost weekly near the presidential Blue House in Seoul, calling for the departure of <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/park_geunhye/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Park Geun-hye.\" class=\"meta-per\">Park Geun-hye</a> as <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\" title=\"More news and information about South Korea.\" class=\"meta-loc\">South Korea</a>\u2019s leader.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"267\" data-total-count=\"481\">On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html\">t</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html\">wo days after the Constitutional Court removed her from office</a> on charges of corruption and abuse of power, they got their wish, as Ms. Park left quietly in a motorcade that whisked her to her two-story red brick house in the southern part of the capital.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"731\">Ms. Park became the first South Korean leader to be forced out of office in response to popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against his corrupt, authoritarian rule.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"965\">\u201cI am sorry that I could not finish the presidential duty that was entrusted to me,\u201d Ms. Park said in a brief statement read by one of her former aides to reporters outside her home. \u201cI will bear with me all the consequences.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"275\" data-total-count=\"1240\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Ms. Park, who has been pressured by the opposition to publicly accept the court\u2019s ruling and whose own party said it \u201chumbly respected\u201d the decision, hinted that she disagreed with it. \u201cIt will take time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I am sure that the truth will be known.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"172\" data-total-count=\"1412\" id=\"story-continues-3\">As the motorcade carrying Ms. Park arrived at the house where she lived from 1990 to 2013, it pulled past hundreds of supporters lining the alley and waving national flags.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"1622\">Ms. Park, who has now lost the privilege of immunity that came with the presidency, stepped out of the car, smiled and shook hands with former aides and party lawmakers who waited for her in front of her house.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"252\" data-total-count=\"1874\">Supporters said they could not accept the Constitutional Court ruling, and held up a variety of signs to express that sentiment: \u201cYou are our president forever!\u201d \u201cWe love you,\u201d and \u201cPark Geun-hye, the president of the people, welcome back!\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"285\" data-total-count=\"2159\" id=\"story-continues-4\">After the court announced its decision on Friday, the flag showing two phoenixes, the presidential symbol of South Korea, was lowered from a Blue House flagpole, but despite the huge significance of her removal from office, Ms. Park could not immediately move out for a prosaic reason.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"236\" data-total-count=\"2395\">Ms. Park\u2019s private home in southern Seoul, which has been unoccupied for the past four years, needed repair. In the past couple of days, workers have been busy fixing its broken boiler, installing new furniture and redecorating rooms.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"248\" data-total-count=\"2643\" id=\"story-continues-5\">After the ruling was announced on Friday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/world/asia/south-korea-president-impeached-protests.html\">thousands of Park supporters, mostly older conservatives, tried to march on the courthouse</a> and called for its destruction, with some clashing with police officers who blocked them with a barricade of buses.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"252\" data-total-count=\"2895\">Three men, in their 60s and 70s, died during the clashes. One of the men died after a steel police speaker fell on his head, and a protester has been arrested on charges of stealing a police bus and ramming it into another, causing the speaker to fall.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"261\" data-total-count=\"3156\" id=\"story-continues-6\">On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/asia/south-korea-impeached-leader-park-geun-hye.html\">Park supporters</a> rallied in central Seoul, vowing to start a political party to fight \u201cpro-North Korea\u201d leftists who they said conspired to bring down Ms. Park and calling the Constitutional Court ruling \u201csedition.\u201d No violence was reported.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"370\" data-total-count=\"3526\">Later, as dusk fell on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans gathered in central Seoul to celebrate Ms. Park\u2019s ouster, dancing to the Queen song \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d and releasing firecrackers. They regard her removal as a key step toward ending what they see as corrupt ties between government and business that have hindered the country for decades.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"358\" data-total-count=\"3884\" id=\"story-continues-7\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html\">Ms. Park\u2019s opponents </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html\"> organized huge candlelight rallies week after week</a>, for months, forcing prosecutors to investigate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-choi-soon-sil.html\">allegations that Ms. Park conspired with her secretive confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to extort millions of dollars</a> from big businesses. Many protesters held signs on Saturday that said: \u201cNow, the next step is to arrest Park Geun-hye!\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"4080\" id=\"story-continues-8\">A reinvigorated news media also helped precipitate Ms. Park\u2019s downfall by exposing incriminating details, like a tablet computer belonging to Ms. Choi that proved her influence in state affairs.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"320\" data-total-count=\"4400\">As Ms. Park\u2019s approval ratings plummeted, the usually sympathetic conservative news media also turned against her, leaving her with few allies beyond right-wing bloggers and some old conservatives who believed that Ms. Park had been framed and that her downfall would bring about a pro-North Korean leftist government.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"380\" data-total-count=\"4780\" id=\"story-continues-9\">The National Assembly voted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">impeach Ms. Park on Dec. 9</a>, asking the Constitutional Court to formally unseat her. Because she was ousted through impeachment, she lost the privileges the government provides to a former president \u2014 including a $10,500 monthly pension payment, an office, a small staff of aides and free medical service \u2014 but she will receive police protection.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"321\" data-total-count=\"5101\">Now an ordinary citizen, Ms. Park is likely to be the subject of a criminal investigation into whether she engaged in corruption. Prosecutors have said she conspired with Ms. Choi to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, like Samsung, and that some of the money represented bribes for political favors.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"287\" data-total-count=\"5388\">When prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/world/asia/lee-jae-yong-samsung.html\">Lee Jae-yong</a>, the de facto head of Samsung, on bribery and other charges, the prosecutors formally identified Ms. Park as a criminal accomplice. But they could not bring charges against her because she was protected from indictment while in office.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"167\" data-total-count=\"5555\">Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who leads the race to replace Ms. Park, criticized her on Sunday for failing to announce in public that she accepts the court ruling.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"222\" data-total-count=\"5777\" id=\"story-continues-10\">Speaking at a news conference, he also said prosecutors should open their corruption investigation into Ms. Park immediately, and warned that she should not remove any potential evidence while moving out of the Blue House.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"288\" data-total-count=\"6065\" id=\"story-continues-11\">Ms. Park has blocked prosecutors from searching her office. When the Constitutional Court ruled against her, it criticized Ms. Park for failing to cooperate with investigators, for trying to hide her wrongdoings, and for impeding the National Assembly\u2019s and the media\u2019s right to know.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"6307\">When Ms. Park was elected as president in late 2012, it marked a triumphant return to the Blue House, where she lived from 1961, when her father, Maj. Gen. Park Chung-hee, seized power in a military coup, until 1979, when he was assassinated.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"130\" data-total-count=\"6437\" id=\"story-continues-12\">Now, Ms. Park has left it again \u2014 almost certainly for the final time \u2014 disgraced, deeply unpopular and as a criminal suspect.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013   Ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye left the presidential palace on Sunday evening, two days after the country's Constitutional Court removed her from office over a massive corruption scandal. \n South Korean television showed Park's motorcade leaving the Blue House and heading for her private home in southern Seoul, where hundreds of police officers, reporters and supporters were gathered in anticipation of her arrival. \n The Constitutional Court formally removed Park from office on Friday, upholding an impeachment motion filed by lawmakers in December amid suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs. \n The ruling ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months and marked a stunning downfall for Park, who convincingly defeated her liberal opponent in 2012 with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who remembered her dictator father as a hero. \n \n Related coverage... \n \n \n \n \n North Korea jumps on South Korean president's ouster, calling her a 'criminal' \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n South Korea's disgraced president formally impeached by court \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n US moves part of missile defense system to South Korea \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hundreds of Park's supporters stood near her private home for hours on Sunday before she vacated the Blue House. They waved the South Korean flag and photos of Park and her late father, Park Chung-hee, singing the national anthem and shouting \"Nullify impeachment!\" \n Members of Park's conservative party also gathered at her home. \n Workers were earlier seen unloading a television, washing machine, bed and other household items from trucks and carrying them into Park's house. \n Park no longer has immunity from prosecution and may face criminal charges including extortion, bribery and abuse of power. \n She has not made a public statement since Friday's court ruling. She earlier apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but strongly denied any legal wrongdoing. \n South Korea now has to elect a new president by early May. Opinion polls show liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed defiance toward the corruption allegations against her as she vacated the presidential palace and returned to her home on Sunday, two days after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.   In her first public comments since the court's ruling, Park said in statement, \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out.\"   Park will likely face a direct investigation soon by prosecutors who already consider her a criminal suspect over suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs.   Upon her return home, Park was greeted by hundreds of supporters who thunderously chanted her name and waved the South Korean flag as her bodyguard-flanked black sedan slowly rolled onto a path near the house. Park, dressed in a dark blue coat and her hair tied in a bun, smiled and waved from inside the car. She then stepped out and shook hands and exchanged brief words with members of her political party before going inside the house.   In her statement, which was read to reporters by Min Kyungwook, a lawmaker from her conservative party and her former spokesman, Park also expressed gratitude to her supporters and apologized for \"failing to fulfill my duty as president.\"   Prior to Sunday, she had apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but strongly denied any legal wrongdoing.   Youn Kwansuk, the spokesman for the liberal Democratic Party, the largest in parliament, called Park's statement \"shocking\" and \"very regrettable\" because she did not express remorse.   \"Former President Park will now be investigated by prosecutors as a civilian and as a criminal suspect,\" Youn said in a statement. \"So it's very regrettable that former President Park decided to waste her last opportunity to come before the nation and show responsibility.\"   Park no longer has immunity from prosecution and may face criminal charges including extortion, bribery and abuse of power.   The Constitutional Court formally removed her from office on Friday, upholding an impeachment motion filed by lawmakers in December that followed weeks of massive protests by millions of people calling for her ouster.   The ruling ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months and marked a stunning downfall for Park, who convincingly defeated her liberal opponent in 2012 with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who remembered her dictator father as a hero.   Her departure from the presidential Blue House on Sunday evening came a day after tens of thousands of opponents and supporters divided the streets of downtown Seoul with massive rallies, reflecting a nation deeply split over its future. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following the court's ruling on Friday.   Park took her time to bid farewell to hundreds of presidential staff members before leaving the Blue House in a motorcade, said presidential spokesman Kim Dong-jo.   Hundreds of supporters stood near her private house for hours waiting for her to return home. They waved the South Korean flag and photos of Park and her late father, Park Chung-hee, singing the national anthem and shouting \"Nullify impeachment!\"   Workers were earlier seen unloading a television, washing machine, bed and other items from trucks and carrying them into Park's house.   South Korea now has to elect a new president by early May. Opinion polls show the Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 Ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed defiance toward the corruption allegations against her as she vacated the presidential palace and returned to her home on Sunday, two days after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.   In her first public comments since the court's ruling, Park said in statement, \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out.\"   Park will likely face a direct investigation soon by prosecutors who already consider her a criminal suspect over suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs.   Upon her return home, Park was greeted by hundreds of supporters who thunderously chanted her name and waved the South Korean flag as her bodyguard-flanked black sedan slowly rolled into a path near the house. Park, dressed in a dark blue coat and her hair tied in a bun, smiled and waved from inside the car. She then stepped out and shook hands and exchanged brief words with members of her political party before going inside the house.   In her statement, which was read to reporters by Min Kyungwook, a lawmaker from her conservative party and her former spokesman, Park also expressed gratitude to her supporters and apologized for \"failing to fulfill my duty as president.\"   Prior to Sunday, she earlier had apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but strongly denied any legal wrongdoing.   Youn Kwansuk, the spokesman for the liberal Democratic Party, the largest in parliament, called Park's statement \"shocking\" and \"very regrettable\" because she did not express remorse.   \"Former President Park will now be investigated by prosecutors as a civilian and as a criminal suspect,\" Youn said in a statement. \"So it's very regrettable that former President Park decided to waste her last opportunity to come before the nation and show responsibility.\"   Park no longer has immunity from prosecution and may face criminal charges including extortion, bribery and abuse of power.   The Constitutional Court formally removed her from office on Friday, upholding an impeachment motion filed by lawmakers in December that followed weeks of massive protests by millions of people calling for her ouster.   The ruling ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months and marked a stunning downfall for Park, who convincingly defeated her liberal opponent in 2012 with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who remembered her dictator father as a hero.   Her departure from the presidential Blue House on Sunday evening came a day after tens of thousands of opponents and supporters divided the streets of downtown Seoul with massive rallies, reflecting a nation deeply split over its future. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following the court's ruling on Friday.   Park took her time to bid farewell to hundreds of presidential staff members before leaving the Blue House in a motorcade, said presidential spokesman Kim Dong-jo.   Hundreds of her supporters stood near her private home for hours before she vacated the Blue House. They waved the South Korean flag and photos of Park and her late father, Park Chung-hee, singing the national anthem and shouting \"Nullify impeachment!\"   Workers were earlier seen unloading a television, washing machine, bed and other household items from trucks and carrying them into Park's house.   South Korea now has to elect a new president by early May. Opinion polls show the Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 Ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed defiance toward the corruption allegations against her as she vacated the presidential palace and returned to her home on Sunday, two days after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.   In her first public comments since the court's ruling, Park said in statement, \"Although it will take time, I believe the truth will certainly come out.\"   Park will likely face a direct investigation soon by prosecutors who already consider her a criminal suspect over suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs.   Upon her return home, Park was greeted by hundreds of supporters who thunderously chanted her name and waved the South Korean flag as her bodyguard-flanked black sedan slowly rolled into a path near the house. Park, dressed in a dark blue coat and her hair tied in a bun, smiled and waved from inside the car. She then stepped out and shook hands and exchanged brief words with members of her political party before going inside the house.   In her statement, which was read to reporters by Min Kyungwook, a lawmaker from her conservative party and her former spokesman, Park also expressed gratitude to her supporters and apologized for \"failing to fulfill my duty as president.\"   Prior to Sunday, she earlier had apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but strongly denied any legal wrongdoing.   Youn Kwansuk, the spokesman for the liberal Democratic Party, the largest in parliament, called Park's statement \"shocking\" and \"very regrettable\" because she did not express remorse.   \"Former President Park will now be investigated by prosecutors as a civilian and as a criminal suspect,\" Youn said in a statement. \"So it's very regrettable that former President Park decided to waste her last opportunity to come before the nation and show responsibility.\"   Park no longer has immunity from prosecution and may face criminal charges including extortion, bribery and abuse of power.   The Constitutional Court formally removed her from office on Friday, upholding an impeachment motion filed by lawmakers in December that followed weeks of massive protests by millions of people calling for her ouster.   The ruling ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months and marked a stunning downfall for Park, who convincingly defeated her liberal opponent in 2012 with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who remembered her dictator father as a hero.   Her departure from the presidential Blue House on Sunday evening came a day after tens of thousands of opponents and supporters divided the streets of downtown Seoul with massive rallies, reflecting a nation deeply split over its future. Three people died and dozens were injured in violent clashes between Park's supporters and police following the court's ruling on Friday.   Park took her time to bid farewell to hundreds of presidential staff members before leaving the Blue House in a motorcade, said presidential spokesman Kim Dong-jo.   Hundreds of her supporters stood near her private home for hours before she vacated the Blue House. They waved the South Korean flag and photos of Park and her late father, Park Chung-hee, singing the national anthem and shouting \"Nullify impeachment!\"   Workers were earlier seen unloading a television, washing machine, bed and other household items from trucks and carrying them into Park's house.   South Korea now has to elect a new president by early May. Opinion polls show the Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 Ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye left the presidential palace on Sunday evening, two days after the country's Constitutional Court removed her from office over a massive corruption scandal.   South Korean television showed Park's motorcade leaving the Blue House and heading for her private home in southern Seoul, where hundreds of police officers, reporters and supporters were gathered in anticipation of her arrival.   The Constitutional Court formally removed Park from office on Friday, upholding an impeachment motion filed by lawmakers in December amid suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.   The ruling ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months and marked a stunning downfall for Park, who convincingly defeated her liberal opponent in 2012 with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who remembered her dictator father as a hero.   Hundreds of Park's supporters stood near her private home for hours on Sunday before she vacated the Blue House. They waved the South Korean flag and photos of Park and her late father, Park Chung-hee, singing the national anthem and shouting \"Nullify impeachment!\"   Members of Park's conservative party also gathered at her home.   Workers were earlier seen unloading a television, washing machine, bed and other household items from trucks and carrying them into Park's house.   Park no longer has immunity from prosecution and may face criminal charges including extortion, bribery and abuse of power.   She has not made a public statement since Friday's court ruling. She earlier apologized for putting trust in her jailed friend, Choi Soon-sil, but strongly denied any legal wrongdoing.   South Korea now has to elect a new president by early May. Opinion polls show liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the favorite to become the country's next leader.",

   "content": "By  Suyeong Lee \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  The South Korean politician likely to emerge as the next president promised justice and common sense on Sunday as workers renovated the home of ousted leader Park Geun-hye to prepare for her departure from the presidential Blue House. The Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to uphold a parliamentary vote to impeach Park, dismissing her from office over an influence-peddling scandal that has shaken the country's political and business elite. A snap presidential election will be held by May 9. Leading in opinion polls to succeed Park is liberal politician Moon Jae-in, who advocates reconciliation with North Korea. \"We still have a long way to go. We have to make this a country of justice, of common sense through regime change,\" Moon told a news conference on Sunday. \"We all have to work together for a complete victory.\" Park, 65, is South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be forced from office.  \n Her ouster followed months of political paralysis and turmoil over a corruption scandal that also landed the head of the Samsung conglomerate in jail and facing trial. Park did not appear in court on Friday and she has not made any comment since. She has remained at the Blue House though would leave at some time and return to her Seoul residence, a spokesman said on Friday. The spokesman was not available for comment on Sunday but media outside her private home in Seoul's upmarket Gangnam district said renovators were working inside the house. \n The Yonhap news agency cited Blue House officials as saying Park was expected to move out of the presidential complex as soon as the renovation on her private home was finished, perhaps on Monday. Thousands of Park's opponents rallied in Seoul on Saturday, where they have been gathering every weekend for months, to celebrate her departure and demand that she be arrested. The former president's conservative supporters also took to the streets not far away, though fewer in number. Police were out in force with riot shields but there were no reports of trouble. \n Two pro-Park protesters were killed as they tried to break through police lines outside the court on Friday. One was believed to have had a heart attack, a hospital official said, and the other died as protesters attacked police buses being used as a barricade. A third protester, a man aged 74, suffered a heart attack and died on Saturday.  Park's dismissal marked a dramatic fall from grace of South Korea's first woman president and daughter of Cold War military dictator Park Chung-hee. She served as his first lady after the 1974 assassination of her mother. Her father, who seized power in a 1961 coup, ruled for 18 years until he was assassinated in 1979. Now, having lost presidential immunity, she could face criminal charges over bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with her friend, Choi Soon-sil. Both women denied wrongdoing.       (Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Stephen Coates)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korean politicians want to ensure that the country never again sees a leader like Park Geun-hye, who was booted from office over an explosive corruption scandal.   But they are far apart on whether doing so would require rewriting the country's 3-decade-old constitution, a treasured symbol of the bloody transition from dictatorship to democracy.   Several parties, including conservatives scrambling to distance themselves from Park, say South Koreans should vote in a new constitution in addition to a new president in early May. They say the shocking downfall of Park, who may face criminal charges over extortion and bribery, shows that the constitution places too much power that is easily abused and often goes unchecked into the hands of the president.   Their proposal for a new constitution is based on power-sharing, where the president is limited to handling foreign affairs and national security and leaves domestic affairs to a prime minister picked by parliament.   However, the party of liberal Moon Jae-in, who opinion polls show as the clear favorite to become South Korea's next leader, opposes a quick constitutional revision and accuses rival parties of plotting a short-cut to power.   The discussions about rewriting the constitution are ironic in that they come after a historic effort to protect it. Lawmakers voted to impeach Park in December on grounds that she \"gravely violated\" the constitution written in 1987, after the government of military strongman Chun Doo-hwan caved in to months of massive protests and accepted demands for presidential elections.   The debate also raises a fundamental question for South Koreans as they mull a new political landscape following Park's demise: Was it a flawed, imperious presidential system that allowed Park to abuse her powers, or a culture that long treated elected heads of states like kings?   The future of the constitution has instantly emerged as a major political topic after the Constitutional Court removed Park on Friday and triggered a two-month presidential race.   Kweon Seong Dong, a lawmaker from the conservative Bareun party and chief prosecutor in Park's impeachment trial, touted his party's line immediately after the ruling.   \"We need a constitutional revision based on power-sharing,\" Kweon said. \"Absolute power absolutely corrupts.\"   Critics refuse to see the court's decision to uphold Park's impeachment as proof that the constitution works as it is. They include none other than one of the court's justices, Ahn Changho.   In a supplementary opinion written into Park's ruling, Ahn found the constitution responsible for an \"imperial presidency\" that breeds \"deplorable political customs,\" such as abuse of power and corruptive ties with the country's biggest companies, which have a tradition of bribing politicians for business favors.   Ahn said the president simply has too much power over the appointment of government officials, making of laws and policies, budget planning and other decisions, which lawmakers find difficult to check for most of the single five-year term.   \"Our country has a winner-takes-it-all representative system where those who win an election, even by just one vote, obtain imperial political power and those who don't get swept to the side and are neglected,\" Ahn wrote.   A constitutional change would need the support of two-thirds of the 300-seat parliament and then pass a national referendum.   Moon, who's likely to be the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, the largest in parliament, says he is open to discussions about constitutional revision, but opposes any changes that take place before or simultaneously with the upcoming presidential election.   He says that two months is too short to properly rewrite the constitution, which not only lays out fundamental principles for power and governance, but also defines the basic rights of citizens.   Besides proposing power-sharing between the president and prime minister, the parties backing a constitutional overhaul also call for the next president's term to be reduced to three years so that a presidential vote can coincide with a parliamentary election in 2020. By then, the parties want a president to be able to serve two four-year terms or a six-year single term.   Some experts question whether South Korea's Constitution is really at fault for power-drunk presidents.   On paper, it seems that the South Korean president domestically has significantly less power than, say, the president of the United States. The South Korean president can't issue executive orders without the consent of lawmakers. The president does appoint a large number of government officials, but needs lawmakers' approval when seating the prime minister, Seoul's No. 2 job.   It's hard to say a system for checks and balances isn't there when lawmakers and a court just combined to kick out a sitting president. This wasn't the first time South Korean lawmakers tried to remove a president either, although the Constitutional Court reinstated late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004.   Perhaps, Park's saga is less of a reflection of the country's constitution than of a rigidly hierarchical culture, where people find it extremely difficult to disobey instructions from above, even when they are inappropriate or unlawful.   The scandal has inspired Democratic Party lawmaker Ki Dong-min to propose a law he says is aimed at allowing government workers to refuse \"unjust\" orders from their bosses. But when a society needs a special law so that people could avoid breaking other laws, then probably laws aren't what the problem is about.   \"South Korea's imperial president wasn't created by laws, but by custom and culture,\" Won-Ho Park, a Seoul National University politics professor, wrote in a newspaper column.   \"The secret to why our president can influence so many things, even the appointment of public university presidents or the personnel decisions of private companies, could perhaps be found in our culture that calls presidential authority as the 'great power' and presidential contenders 'hidden dragons,'\" he said.   ___   Follow Kim Tong-hyung at  www.twitter.com/KimTongHyung",

They say the shocking downfall of Park, who may face criminal charges over extortion and bribery, shows that the constitution places too much power that is easily abused and often goes unchecked into the hands of the president.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Their proposal for a new constitution is based on power-sharing, where the president is limited to handling foreign affairs and national security and leaves domestic affairs to a prime minister picked by parliament.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">However, the party of liberal Moon Jae-in, who opinion polls show as the clear favorite to become South Korea's next leader, opposes a quick constitutional revision and accuses rival parties of plotting a short-cut to power.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The discussions about rewriting the constitution are ironic in that they come after a historic effort to protect it. Lawmakers voted to impeach Park in December on grounds that she \"gravely violated\" the constitution written in 1987, after the government of military strongman Chun Doo-hwan caved in to months of massive protests and accepted demands for presidential elections.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The debate also raises a fundamental question for South Koreans as they mull a new political landscape following Park's demise: Was it a flawed, imperious presidential system that allowed Park to abuse her powers, or a culture that long treated elected heads of states like kings?</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The future of the constitution has instantly emerged as a major political topic after the Constitutional Court removed Park on Friday and triggered a two-month presidential race.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Kweon Seong Dong, a lawmaker from the conservative Bareun party and chief prosecutor in Park's impeachment trial, touted his party's line immediately after the ruling.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"We need a constitutional revision based on power-sharing,\" Kweon said. \"Absolute power absolutely corrupts.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Critics refuse to see the court's decision to uphold Park's impeachment as proof that the constitution works as it is. They include none other than one of the court's justices, Ahn Changho.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In a supplementary opinion written into Park's ruling, Ahn found the constitution responsible for an \"imperial presidency\" that breeds \"deplorable political customs,\" such as abuse of power and corruptive ties with the country's biggest companies, which have a tradition of bribing politicians for business favors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Ahn said the president simply has too much power over the appointment of government officials, making of laws and policies, budget planning and other decisions, which lawmakers find difficult to check for most of the single five-year term.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"Our country has a winner-takes-it-all representative system where those who win an election, even by just one vote, obtain imperial political power and those who don't get swept to the side and are neglected,\" Ahn wrote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A constitutional change would need the support of two-thirds of the 300-seat parliament and then pass a national referendum.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Moon, who's likely to be the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, the largest in parliament, says he is open to discussions about constitutional revision, but opposes any changes that take place before or simultaneously with the upcoming presidential election.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">He says that two months is too short to properly rewrite the constitution, which not only lays out fundamental principles for power and governance, but also defines the basic rights of citizens.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Besides proposing power-sharing between the president and prime minister, the parties backing a constitutional overhaul also call for the next president's term to be reduced to three years so that a presidential vote can coincide with a parliamentary election in 2020. By then, the parties want a president to be able to serve two four-year terms or a six-year single term.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some experts question whether South Korea's Constitution is really at fault for power-drunk presidents.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">On paper, it seems that the South Korean president domestically has significantly less power than, say, the president of the United States. The South Korean president can't issue executive orders without the consent of lawmakers. The president does appoint a large number of government officials, but needs lawmakers' approval when seating the prime minister, Seoul's No. 2 job.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It's hard to say a system for checks and balances isn't there when lawmakers and a court just combined to kick out a sitting president. This wasn't the first time South Korean lawmakers tried to remove a president either, although the Constitutional Court reinstated late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Perhaps, Park's saga is less of a reflection of the country's constitution than of a rigidly hierarchical culture, where people find it extremely difficult to disobey instructions from above, even when they are inappropriate or unlawful.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The scandal has inspired Democratic Party lawmaker Ki Dong-min to propose a law he says is aimed at allowing government workers to refuse \"unjust\" orders from their bosses. But when a society needs a special law so that people could avoid breaking other laws, then probably laws aren't what the problem is about.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"South Korea's imperial president wasn't created by laws, but by custom and culture,\" Won-Ho Park, a Seoul National University politics professor, wrote in a newspaper column.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"The secret to why our president can influence so many things, even the appointment of public university presidents or the personnel decisions of private companies, could perhaps be found in our culture that calls presidential authority as the 'great power' and presidential contenders 'hidden dragons,'\" he said.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Follow Kim Tong-hyung at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/KimTongHyung\">www.twitter.com/KimTongHyung</a></p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 A day after a court removed her from power over a corruption scandal, ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye maintained her silence on Saturday as her opponents and supporters divided the capital's streets with massive rallies that showed a nation deeply split over its future.   Park has been unseen and unheard from since the Constitutional Court's ruling on Friday, which ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months. Park, whose fate was left in the court's hands after her parliamentary impeachment in December, has yet to vacate the presidential Blue House, with her aides saying they need more time to prepare for her return to her private home in Seoul.   Carrying flags and candles and cheering jubilantly, tens of thousands of people occupied a boulevard in downtown Seoul to celebrate Park's ouster. Meanwhile, in a nearby grass square, a large crowd of Park's supporters glumly waved national flags near a stage where organizers, wearing red caps and military uniforms, vowed to resist what they called a \"political assassination.\"   Police had braced for violence between the two crowds after three people died and dozens were injured in clashes between police and Park's supporters after the ruling on Friday. Nearly 20,000 police officers were deployed on Saturday to monitor the protesters, who were also separated by tight perimeters created by hundreds of police buses.   The anti-Park protesters shouted \"The candles have won!\" and \"Arrest Park Geun-hye!\" as they began marching toward the Blue House. The protesters, who held candles during their massive evening demonstrations in recent months, loosely call themselves the Candle Force.   The court's decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader. Park rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   While the ruling might have irrevocably derailed Park's political career, analysts saw defiance in her silence, saying that Park was perhaps hoping to use the growing anger of her followers to rebuild support.   \"By being quiet, she's making it loud and clear that she won't accept the court's ruling,\" said Yul Shin, a professor at Seoul's Myongji University. \"Nobody knows when she will leave the Blue House, but maybe she wanted to see how large the crowd was tonight at the pro-Park rally.\"   The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as it faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the Trump administration's commitment to the U.S.-South Korea security alliance.   South Korea must hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion polls.   Kim Yong-deok, the chief of the National Election Commission, said Saturday that the election would be managed \"accurately and perfectly\" and urged the public to participate in a vote that would \"determine the fate of the Republic of Korea,\" referring to South Korea's formal name.   The Constitutional Court accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Choi and Samsung's de facto chief, Lee Jae-yong.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared her impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders and climbing on police buses. Police and hospital officials said three people died while protesting Park's removal, including a man in his 70s who died early Saturday after collapsing near the court.   ___   Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim and Foster Klug contributed to this report.",

Park has been unseen and unheard from since the Constitutional Court's ruling on Friday, which ended a power struggle that had consumed the nation for months. She has yet to vacate the presidential Blue House, with her aides saying they need more time to prepare for her return to her private home in southern Seoul.   Carrying flags and candles and cheering jubilantly, tens of thousands of people occupied a boulevard in downtown Seoul to celebrate Park's ouster.

South Korea must hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion polls.   Kim Yong-deok, the chief of the National Election Commission, said Saturday that the election would be managed \"accurately and perfectly\" and urged the public to participate in a vote that would \"determine the fate of the Republic of Korea,\" referring to South Korea's formal name.   The Constitutional Court accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Choi and Samsung's de facto chief, Lee Jae-yong.

She has yet to vacate the presidential Blue House, with her aides saying they need more time to prepare for her return to her private home in southern Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Carrying flags and candles and cheering jubilantly, tens of thousands of people occupied a boulevard in downtown Seoul to celebrate Park's ouster. Meanwhile, in a nearby grass square, a large crowd of Park's supporters glumly waved national flags near a stage where organizers, wearing red caps and military uniforms, vowed to resist what they called a \"political assassination.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Police had braced for violence between the two crowds after three people died and dozens were injured in clashes between police and Park's supporters after the ruling on Friday. Nearly 20,000 police officers were deployed on Saturday to monitor the protesters, who were also separated by tight perimeters created by hundreds of police buses.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The anti-Park protesters shouted \"The candles have won!\" and \"Arrest Park Geun-hye!\" as they began marching toward the Blue House. The protesters, who held candles during their massive evening demonstrations in recent months, loosely call themselves the Candle Force.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The court's decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader. Park rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">While the ruling might have irrevocably derailed Park's political career, analysts saw defiance in her silence, saying that Park was perhaps hoping to use the growing anger of her followers to rebuild support.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"By being quiet, she's making it loud and clear that she won't accept the court's ruling,\" said Yul Shin, a professor at Seoul's Myongji University. \"Nobody knows when she will leave the Blue House, but maybe she wanted to see how large the crowd was tonight at the pro-Park rally.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as it faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the Trump administration's commitment to the U.S.-South Korea security alliance.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor.

   "content": "By  Jeongeun Lee \n |  SEOUL \n \n SEOUL  Opponents of South Korea's ousted leader, Park Geun-hye, demanded on Saturday that she be arrested a day after she was thrown out of office over a corruption scandal involving the country's conglomerates. Park's critics said they would rally in central Seoul, where they have been gathering every weekend for months, while the former president's conservative supporters also planned protests, raising the risk of confrontation. The Constitutional Court ruling on Friday to uphold a parliamentary vote to impeach Park infuriated hundreds of her supporters, two of whom were killed as they tried to break through police lines outside the court. A 74-year-old man involved in the protest had a heart attack and died on Saturday, a hospital spokeswoman said. \"We demand the arrest of Park Geun-hye and the resignation of acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn,\" said Choi In-sook, a spokeswoman for protesters, told Reuters. Prime Minister Hwang, a Park loyalist, became acting president when parliament voted to impeach her on Dec. 9. Hwang called for calm on Friday and promised that a snap presidential election, which has to be held within 60 days, would be smooth. The election commission was due to make an announcement on Saturday. Protesters were setting up equipment in central Seoul early on Saturday and small groups of police were on the streets. \n Park is South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be forced from office. He followed months of political paralysis and turmoil over a corruption scandal that also landed the head of the Samsung conglomerate in jail and facing trial. Park did not appear in court and did not make any comment after the ruling. She spent Friday night in the presidential Blue House residence though would leave at some time, and return to her private Seoul residence, a spokesman said. FALL FROM GRACE \n \n The court ruling marks a dramatic fall from grace of South Korea's first woman president and daughter of Cold War military dictator Park Chung-hee, both of whose parents were assassinated. Park, 65, no longer has immunity as president, and could now face criminal charges over bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with her friend, Choi Soon-sil.  A liberal candidate, Moon Jae-in, is leading in opinion polls to succeed Park, with 32 percent in one released on Friday. Relations with China and the United States could dominate the presidential campaign, after South Korea this month began deployment of the U.S. THAAD missile defense system in response to North Korea's stepped up missile and nuclear tests. \n Beijing has vigorously protested against the deployment, fearing its radar could see into its missile deployments. China has curbed travel to South Korea and targeted Korean companies operating in the mainland, prompting retaliatory measures from Seoul.  Reform of the country's giant conglomerates, known as \"chaebol\", will also be an election issue. Park was accused of soliciting bribes from the head of the Samsung Group, the country's largest conglomerate, for government favors. Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee has been accused of bribery and embezzlement in connection with the scandal and is in detention. His trial began on Thursday. He and Samsung have denied wrongdoing.

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean police on Saturday braced for more violence between opponents and supporters of ousted President Park Geun-hye, who was stripped of her powers by the Constitutional Court over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into a political turmoil.   Three people died and dozens were injured in clashes between police and Park's supporters after the ruling Friday, according to police, which detained seven protesters for questioning.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency was planning to deploy nearly 20,000 officers and hundreds of buses to separate the two crowds, whose passionate rallies have divided the streets near the presidential palace in the past several weekends as the scandal worsened.   The court's decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader. Park rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as it faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Kim Yong-deok, the chief of the National Election Commission, said Saturday that the election will be managed \"accurately and perfectly\" and urged the public to participate in a vote that would \"determine the fate of the Republic of Korea,\" referring to South Korea's formal name.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Park hasn't vacated the presidential Blue House yet, as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to her office. Park has not made a public statement on her removal.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared her impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders and climbing on police buses. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the acting head of state, pleaded for peace and urge protesters to move on. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   Police and hospital officials said three people died while protesting Park's removal. A man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died after a large speaker that had been mounted on a police truck fell on his head, police said. They are questioning a Park supporter who allegedly knocked off the speaker by stealing a police bus and crashing it into the truck.   Police said that another man in his 70s died early Saturday after collapsing near the court. An official from the nearby Kangbuk Samsung Hospital said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   ___   Associated Press writers Hyung-jing Kim and Foster Klug contributed to this report.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean police on Saturday braced for more violence between opponents and supporters of ousted President Park Geun-hye, who was stripped of her powers by the Constitutional Court over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into a political turmoil.   Three people died and dozens were injured in clashes between police and Park's supporters after the ruling Friday, according to police, which detained seven protesters for questioning.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency was planning to deploy nearly 20,000 officers and hundreds of buses to separate the two crowds, whose passionate rallies have divided the streets near the presidential palace in the past several weekends as the scandal worsened.   The court's decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader. Park rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as it faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Kim Yong-deok, the chief of the National Election Commission, said Saturday that the election will be managed \"accurately and perfectly\" and urged the public to participate in a vote that would \"determine the fate of the Republic of Korea,\" referring to South Korea's formal name.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Park hasn't vacated the presidential Blue House yet, as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to her office. Park has not made a public statement on her removal.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared her impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders and climbing on police buses. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the acting head of state, pleaded for peace and urge protesters to move on. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   Police and hospital officials said three people died while protesting Park's removal. A man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died after a large speaker that had been mounted on a police truck fell on his head, police said. They are questioning a Park supporter who allegedly knocked off the speaker by stealing a police bus and crashing it into the truck.   Police said that another man in his 70s died early Saturday after collapsing near the court. An official from the nearby Kangbuk Samsung Hospital said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   ___   Associated Press writers Hyung-jing Kim and Foster Klug contributed to this report.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Their foes have called them blindly na\u00efve, closet  North Korea  followers and anti-American \u2014 an unsettling slight in  South Korea , where the United States alliance has been the military bedrock for seven decades.   Now South Korea\u2019s liberal opposition leaders, out of power for almost 10 years, are on the verge of retaking the presidency with the historic court ruling on Friday that  ousted their conservative enemy, President Park Geun-hye , who had been impeached in a corruption scandal.   Their presidential hopeful, Moon Jae-in, wants a profound change in the country\u2019s tense relations with North Korea, pushing outreach and dialogue. He also is deeply skeptical of the hawkish stance embraced by the conservatives and South Korea\u2019s most important defender, the United States.   Mr. Moon and his liberal partners are especially worried about a new antimissile shield the Americans are installing in South Korea, citing China\u2019s fury over it and warning of a  standoff reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis.    Much has changed since South Korea\u2019s liberals were running the country. The North not only has amassed  nuclear weapons  but claims it can fit them atop missiles. It has  successfully launched multiple missiles that could hit Japan , and could soon perfect models that could reach the United States.   North Korea now has an unpredictable, 33-year-old leader,  Kim Jong-un , who styles himself in the godlike image of his grandfather, the hermetic country\u2019s Communist revolutionary founder. He appears even more obsessed with nuclear weapons than his father and predecessor,  Kim Jong-il , and has threatened South Korea and its allies with pre-emptive nuclear attack.   The challenges for Mr. Moon and his liberal partners as they push to reclaim power in elections now scheduled for May will be how to engage with a far more dangerous North Korea, maintain close ties with the United States, and repair relations with China, which increasingly mistrusts the American military\u2019s intentions.   Mr. Moon has called himself \u201cAmerica\u2019s friend,\u201d grateful that the United States protected South Korea from communism and supported its economic growth and democratization. The alliance with Washington is \u201ca pillar of our diplomacy,\u201d he said in an interview on the eve of Ms. Park\u2019s court-ordered ouster.   But he also said South Korea should learn to \u201csay \u2018No\u2019 to the Americans.\u201d   Mr. Moon\u2019s ascent could seriously complicate the American rush this past week to deploy the new advanced missile-defense system, known as  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense , or Thaad, in the South.   He and his liberal associates have questioned the deployment, calling it an unnecessary escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The missile system would put sophisticated American weaponry on China\u2019s doorstep, and has infuriated the Chinese so much they are  boycotting South Korean brands  and may now be less willing to use economic leverage to rein in the North.   Ms. Park\u2019s government considered Thaad a centerpiece in defending against the growing North Korean missile threat. But Mr. Moon vowed to review the deployment if elected.   \u201cI cannot understand why there should be such a hurry with this,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that they are trying to make it a fait accompli, make it a political issue to be used in the election.\u201d   As of Friday, the Trump administration had said nothing publicly about Ms. Park\u2019s removal and its implications for South Korea\u2019s relations with the United States. But Mr. Trump\u2019s United Nations envoy,  Nikki R. Haley, made clear earlier this week that she sees no point in dialogue with North Korea\u2019s leader , whom she described as \u201cnot rational,\u201d and that the Thaad deployment was not directed at China.   Mr. Moon said he abhorred \u201cthe ruthless dictatorial regime of North Korea.\u201d But he also said sanctions that the United States had enforced with the conservatives in South Korea for a decade had failed to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, so it was time to try something less confrontational.   \u201cWe must embrace the North Korean people as part of the Korean nation, and to do that, whether we like it or not, we must recognize Kim Jong-un as their ruler and as our dialogue partner,\u201d Mr. Moon said.   That idea is not entirely new. The last time the liberals were in power, from 1998 to 2008, they pushed the so-called Sunshine Policy of promoting aid and exchanges with North Korea in the hopes of building trust and guiding it toward openness and nuclear disarmament.   The result was an unprecedented d\u00e9tente on the divided Korean Peninsula. But the North persisted in its nuclear weapons pursuits, conducting its first nuclear test in 2006.   It has since conducted four more. It also has demonstrated advances in missile technology that have deeply worried not only the United States but all countries in the region, including China, leading to multiple sets of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council.   Analysts have said that engagement with the North is now riskier, given the United Nations sanctions, and is likely costlier, given how much North Korea\u2019s nuclear stockpile has grown. But Mr. Moon said the strategy pursued by the conservatives was simply not working.   \u201cWhat have the conservative governments done, except badmouthing the North?\u201d he said. \u201cIf necessary, we will have to strengthen sanctions even further, but the goal of sanctions must be to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.\u201d   The possibility that Mr. Moon could become South Korea\u2019s next president in a few months also comes as the Trump administration is formulating a new policy on North Korea. Ms. Haley said on Tuesday that \u201cwe\u2019re considering every option.\u201d   \u201cI hope that Mr. Trump will come to the same conclusion as I did,\u201d Mr. Moon said.   As part of his outreach to the North, Mr. Moon said he would reopen the joint-venture factory complex the two Koreas had run in the North Korean town of Kaesong. After Mr. Kim\u2019s government conducted a nuclear test in January last year, Ms. Park  closed  the Kaesong venture , saying it violated United Nations sanctions.   Analysts of the Korean Peninsula conflict said it was premature to assess the outcome of Ms. Park\u2019s removal.   \u201cA giant leap forward for South Korean democracy, a major step backward for taming Pyongyang,\u201d said  Lee Sung-yoon , a North Korea expert at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in the United States.   For the past decade, South Korea has been governed by conservative leaders who regard anything less than unequivocal support for the alliance with Washington and the downfall of the Kim Jong-un government as ideologically suspect.   Their liberal adversaries would bring in a new mentality.   Mr. Moon grew up in a family that hated the Communist rule in the North but also had roots there. His parents were among tens of thousands of Korean War refugees on the run from Communists who were evacuated from the North Korean port of Hungnam by retreating American Navy vessels in the winter of 1950.   But Mr. Moon also belonged to the generation of South Koreans who shaped their perspectives by fighting the anti-North Korean, pro-American military dictators, like Park Chung-hee, Ms. Park\u2019s father, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979.   In college in the 1970s, Mr. Moon said he was profoundly influenced by Rhee Young-hee, a dissident journalist who wrote a book criticizing the Vietnam War. The military government, which sent its troops to fight for the Americans in Vietnam, banned the book and arrested the writer.   \u201cUntil then, we were taught to think that whatever the United States did was justice, whatever the United States said was truth, and that whoever argued otherwise was an evil to repel,\u201d Mr. Moon wrote in his 2011 memoir \u201cFate.\u201d \u201cThe book helped lift the veil of falsehood.\u201d   Some of the old student activists, like Mr. Moon, from the 1970s and \u201980s form the mainstay of the political opposition of today.   They do not want their country dragged into what they see as a hegemonic struggle among big powers, while conservatives have no qualms about siding with the United States in its rivalry with China. The Thaad antimissile deployment showcased those opposing perspectives.   As the Americans pushed ahead with the deployment this week in an apparent attempt to embed the system before a new government takes power, China retaliated by forcing South Korean businesses there to close and banning Chinese tourists from visiting the South.   \u201cThe United States is pushing us to the West unnecessarily, and China is shoving us to the East unnecessarily,\u201d said Kim Ki-jung, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul and foreign policy adviser for Mr. Moon. \u201cThey should not push us too much; part of the Korean DNA is resistance against big powers.\u201d",

He also is deeply skeptical of the hawkish stance embraced by the conservatives and South Korea\u2019s most important defender, the United States.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"230\" data-total-count=\"1035\">Mr. Moon and his liberal partners are especially worried about a new antimissile shield the Americans are installing in South Korea, citing China\u2019s fury over it and warning of a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/asia/korea%2Dmissile%2Ddefense%2Dchina%2Dtrump.html\">standoff reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. </a></p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"297\" data-total-count=\"1332\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Much has changed since South Korea\u2019s liberals were running the country. The North not only has amassed <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/atomic_weapons/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about nuclear weapons.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">nuclear weapons</a> but claims it can fit them atop missiles. It has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/world/north-korea-ballistic-missiles.html\">successfully launched multiple missiles that could hit Japan</a>, and could soon perfect models that could reach the United States.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"364\" data-total-count=\"1696\" id=\"story-continues-3\">North Korea now has an unpredictable, 33-year-old leader, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/kim_jongun/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Kim Jong-un.\" class=\"meta-per\">Kim Jong-un</a>, who styles himself in the godlike image of his grandfather, the hermetic country\u2019s Communist revolutionary founder. He appears even more obsessed with nuclear weapons than his father and predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/world/asia/kim-jong-il-is-dead.html?pagewanted=all\">Kim Jong-il</a>, and has threatened South Korea and its allies with pre-emptive nuclear attack.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"322\" data-total-count=\"2018\">The challenges for Mr. Moon and his liberal partners as they push to reclaim power in elections now scheduled for May will be how to engage with a far more dangerous North Korea, maintain close ties with the United States, and repair relations with China, which increasingly mistrusts the American military\u2019s intentions.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"315\" data-total-count=\"2333\">Mr. Moon has called himself \u201cAmerica\u2019s friend,\u201d grateful that the United States protected South Korea from communism and supported its economic growth and democratization. The alliance with Washington is \u201ca pillar of our diplomacy,\u201d he said in an interview on the eve of Ms. Park\u2019s court-ordered ouster.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"81\" data-total-count=\"2414\" id=\"story-continues-4\">But he also said South Korea should learn to \u201csay \u2018No\u2019 to the Americans.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"200\" data-total-count=\"2614\">Mr. Moon\u2019s ascent could seriously complicate the American rush this past week to deploy the new advanced missile-defense system, known as <a href=\"https://www.mda.mil/system/thaad.html\">Terminal High Altitude Area Defense</a>, or Thaad, in the South.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"373\" data-total-count=\"2987\">He and his liberal associates have questioned the deployment, calling it an unnecessary escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The missile system would put sophisticated American weaponry on China\u2019s doorstep, and has infuriated the Chinese so much they are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/china-lotte-thaad-south-korea.html\">boycotting South Korean brands</a> and may now be less willing to use economic leverage to rein in the North.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"172\" data-total-count=\"3159\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Ms. Park\u2019s government considered Thaad a centerpiece in defending against the growing North Korean missile threat. But Mr. Moon vowed to review the deployment if elected.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"197\" data-total-count=\"3356\">\u201cI cannot understand why there should be such a hurry with this,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that they are trying to make it a fait accompli, make it a political issue to be used in the election.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"414\" data-total-count=\"3770\" id=\"story-continues-6\">As of Friday, the Trump administration had said nothing publicly about Ms. Park\u2019s removal and its implications for South Korea\u2019s relations with the United States. But Mr. Trump\u2019s United Nations envoy, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/asia/china-north-korea-thaad-nuclear.html\">Nikki R. Haley, made clear earlier this week that she sees no point in dialogue with North Korea\u2019s leader</a>, whom she described as \u201cnot rational,\u201d and that the Thaad deployment was not directed at China.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"307\" data-total-count=\"4077\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Mr. Moon said he abhorred \u201cthe ruthless dictatorial regime of North Korea.\u201d But he also said sanctions that the United States had enforced with the conservatives in South Korea for a decade had failed to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, so it was time to try something less confrontational.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"207\" data-total-count=\"4284\" id=\"story-continues-8\">\u201cWe must embrace the North Korean people as part of the Korean nation, and to do that, whether we like it or not, we must recognize Kim Jong-un as their ruler and as our dialogue partner,\u201d Mr. Moon said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"268\" data-total-count=\"4552\">That idea is not entirely new. The last time the liberals were in power, from 1998 to 2008, they pushed the so-called Sunshine Policy of promoting aid and exchanges with North Korea in the hopes of building trust and guiding it toward openness and nuclear disarmament.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"173\" data-total-count=\"4725\" id=\"story-continues-9\">The result was an unprecedented d\u00e9tente on the divided Korean Peninsula. But the North persisted in its nuclear weapons pursuits, conducting its first nuclear test in 2006.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"269\" data-total-count=\"4994\">It has since conducted four more. It also has demonstrated advances in missile technology that have deeply worried not only the United States but all countries in the region, including China, leading to multiple sets of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"269\" data-total-count=\"5263\">Analysts have said that engagement with the North is now riskier, given the United Nations sanctions, and is likely costlier, given how much North Korea\u2019s nuclear stockpile has grown. But Mr. Moon said the strategy pursued by the conservatives was simply not working.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"246\" data-total-count=\"5509\">\u201cWhat have the conservative governments done, except badmouthing the North?\u201d he said. \u201cIf necessary, we will have to strengthen sanctions even further, but the goal of sanctions must be to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"243\" data-total-count=\"5752\">The possibility that Mr. Moon could become South Korea\u2019s next president in a few months also comes as the Trump administration is formulating a new policy on North Korea. Ms. Haley said on Tuesday that \u201cwe\u2019re considering every option.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"85\" data-total-count=\"5837\" id=\"story-continues-10\">\u201cI hope that Mr. Trump will come to the same conclusion as I did,\u201d Mr. Moon said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"319\" data-total-count=\"6156\">As part of his outreach to the North, Mr. Moon said he would reopen the joint-venture factory complex the two Koreas had run in the North Korean town of Kaesong. After Mr. Kim\u2019s government conducted a nuclear test in January last year, Ms. Park <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/world/asia/north-south-korea-kaesong.html\">closed </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/world/asia/north-south-korea-kaesong.html\">the Kaesong venture</a>, saying it violated United Nations sanctions.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"110\" data-total-count=\"6266\" id=\"story-continues-11\">Analysts of the Korean Peninsula conflict said it was premature to assess the outcome of Ms. Park\u2019s removal.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"222\" data-total-count=\"6488\" id=\"story-continues-12\">\u201cA giant leap forward for South Korean democracy, a major step backward for taming Pyongyang,\u201d said <a href=\"http://fletcher.tufts.edu/Fletcher_Directory/Directory/Faculty%20Profile?personkey=43424CD6-91DF-469E-83CC-E9DD75B6B913\">Lee Sung-yoon</a>, a North Korea expert at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in the United States.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"230\" data-total-count=\"6718\">For the past decade, South Korea has been governed by conservative leaders who regard anything less than unequivocal support for the alliance with Washington and the downfall of the Kim Jong-un government as ideologically suspect.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"57\" data-total-count=\"6775\" id=\"story-continues-13\">Their liberal adversaries would bring in a new mentality.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"304\" data-total-count=\"7079\">Mr. Moon grew up in a family that hated the Communist rule in the North but also had roots there. His parents were among tens of thousands of Korean War refugees on the run from Communists who were evacuated from the North Korean port of Hungnam by retreating American Navy vessels in the winter of 1950.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"7321\">But Mr. Moon also belonged to the generation of South Koreans who shaped their perspectives by fighting the anti-North Korean, pro-American military dictators, like Park Chung-hee, Ms. Park\u2019s father, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"282\" data-total-count=\"7603\">In college in the 1970s, Mr. Moon said he was profoundly influenced by Rhee Young-hee, a dissident journalist who wrote a book criticizing the Vietnam War. The military government, which sent its troops to fight for the Americans in Vietnam, banned the book and arrested the writer.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"285\" data-total-count=\"7888\">\u201cUntil then, we were taught to think that whatever the United States did was justice, whatever the United States said was truth, and that whoever argued otherwise was an evil to repel,\u201d Mr. Moon wrote in his 2011 memoir \u201cFate.\u201d \u201cThe book helped lift the veil of falsehood.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"131\" data-total-count=\"8019\" id=\"story-continues-14\">Some of the old student activists, like Mr. Moon, from the 1970s and \u201980s form the mainstay of the political opposition of today.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"269\" data-total-count=\"8288\" id=\"story-continues-15\">They do not want their country dragged into what they see as a hegemonic struggle among big powers, while conservatives have no qualms about siding with the United States in its rivalry with China. The Thaad antimissile deployment showcased those opposing perspectives.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"8548\">As the Americans pushed ahead with the deployment this week in an apparent attempt to embed the system before a new government takes power, China retaliated by forcing South Korean businesses there to close and banning Chinese tourists from visiting the South.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"323\" data-total-count=\"8871\">\u201cThe United States is pushing us to the West unnecessarily, and China is shoving us to the East unnecessarily,\u201d said Kim Ki-jung, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul and foreign policy adviser for Mr. Moon. \u201cThey should not push us too much; part of the Korean DNA is resistance against big powers.\u201d</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean police on Saturday braced for more violence between opponents and supporters of ousted President Park Geun-hye, who was stripped of her powers by the Constitutional Court over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into a political turmoil.   Three people died and dozens were injured in clashes between police and Park's supporters after the ruling Friday, according to police, which detained seven protesters for questioning.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency was planning to deploy nearly 20,000 officers and hundreds of buses to separate the two crowds, whose passionate rallies have divided the streets near the presidential palace in the past several weekends as the scandal worsened.   The court's decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader. Park rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as it faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Park hasn't vacated the presidential Blue House yet, as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to her office. Park has not made a public statement on her removal.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared her impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders and climbing on police buses. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the acting head of state, pleaded for peace and urge protesters to move on. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   Police and hospital officials said three people died while protesting Park's removal. A man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died after a large speaker that had been mounted on a police truck fell on his head, police said. They are questioning a Park supporter who allegedly knocked off the speaker by stealing a police bus and crashing it into the truck.   Police said that another man in his 70s died early Saturday after collapsing near the court. An official from the nearby Kangbuk Samsung Hospital said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   ___   Associated Press writers Hyung-jing Kim and Foster Klug contributed to this report.",

   "content": "North Korea wasted no time in bashing South Korea's ousted president Friday, calling her a \"common criminal\" -- and signaling that the countries' decades-long war was no close to ending. \n The South Korean leader, Park Geun-hye, \"had one more year left as 'president' but, now she's been ousted, she will be investigated as a common criminal,\" North Korea's state KCNA news agency reported. It was an unusually quick response from the rogue nation, which typically waits days to report international news,  according to Reuters . \n SOUTH KOREA'S DISGRACED PRESIDENT FORMALLY IMPEACHED BY COURT \n South Korea's Constitutional Court removed Park from office in a unanimous ruling earlier Friday over a corruption scandal that plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide. The decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader, who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets. \n The Korean War, which started in 1950, saw a stop to fighting in 1953 -- but the countries never signed a peace treaty, meaning they are still technically at war. North Korea's push to expand its missile arsenal has only made the situation worse, analysts have said. \n KIM JONG NAM'S SON APPARENTLY SHOWS HIS FACE FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DAD'S MURDER \n In addition, the U.S. deployment of a high-tech missile defense system in South Korea has riled up China, which claimed the Pentagon was trying to beef up its spying capabilities. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last month met with top South Korean officials and said \"he had inherited an already strong Alliance, but committed to spending his tenure making it stronger than ever,\" Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, reported. \n \"As much as our position pertaining to national security should remain unwavering regardless of the domestic political situation, we will continue to maintain steady preparedness in close cooperation with our diplomatic and security agencies with regards to North Korea,\" government officials in Seoul said. \n \n \n \n \n \n Two people died during protests that followed the court ruling. Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on. \n The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park -- prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect -- and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s. \n Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\" \n Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution. \n Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park has not made a public statement on her removal. \n Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\" \n South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

   "content": "Silence fell over thousands of supporters of  South Korea \u2019s president,  Park Geun-hye , as the country\u2019s Constitutional Court  announced it was removing her from office  on Friday. The unanimous ruling capped months of turmoil for a country that has been gripped by the  corruption scandal  that brought down Ms. Park.   Since November, the center of Seoul, the capital, has been the site of weekly demonstrations,  some of them enormous , demanding Ms. Park\u2019s ouster. Her powers  were suspended in December , after a legislative impeachment vote.   Her opponents were in the streets on Friday for the ruling, cheering as the court verdict was read.   Supporters of Ms. Park tried to pass a barricade of police buses protecting the Constitutional Court, which ruled that Ms. Park had \u201cbetrayed the trust of the people.\u201d Some of the demonstrators called for \u201cdestroying\u201d the court.   Some of Ms. Park\u2019s supporters, most of them older South Koreans, attacked the police with flagpoles. As Ms. Park\u2019s standing plummeted in recent months, her remaining backers tended to be people who fondly remembered her father, the Cold War dictator Park Chung-hee.   Other protesters threw water bottles and pieces of pavement. The acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, called for national unity and urged Ms. Park\u2019s supporters to accept the court\u2019s ruling.   Two pro-Park demonstrators, ages 60 and 72, died during the unrest. One had fallen from the top of a police bus, a hospital official  told The Associated Press . An additional 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the clashes, The A.P. said.",

   "content": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korea has been plunged into a period of political uncertainty after the President, Park Geun-hye, was forced out of office by a corruption scandal.   The country's Constitutional Court upheld a parliamentary vote to impeach Park over allegations of corruption and cronyism. She becomes the country's first democratically elected leader to be forcibly removed.   Two died amid chaotic scenes in the capital, Seoul. Thousands demonstrated after the unanimous decision by eight judges was read out down in a live broadcast that gripped the nation.   The decision brings the career of South Korea's first female president to an inglorious end. It also comes at a pivotal moment for the region, as North Korea  ramps up its nuclear weapons testing program.   Here are the main developments:   Stripped of her immunity, Park is liable to prosecution. A snap presidential election will be held within 60 days. Turmoil comes as tensions rise with North Korea and China. Acting president warns North Korea may take advantage the uncertainty. The scandal has also entangled the acting head of Samsung.    What happened?   Park was brought down by a  corruption scandal that has dominated South Korean politics for months .    The President was accused of being unduly influenced by her longtime friend and adviser, Choi Soon-sil, who is on trial for abuse of power and fraud.   The Constitutional Court agreed with accusations that Park had abused her authority in helping Choi raise donations from companies for foundations she had set up.   \"We announce the decision as the unanimous opinion of all judges. We dismiss the defendant President Park,\" said Justice Lee Jung-mi.   READ MORE: What happens next?   An election for Park's replacement must be held within 60 days, and an ad-hoc cabinet meeting will be held soon, a government official told CNN.   With Park's ruling conservatives looking out of favor, it  seems likely the country will turn to the left-wing opposition,  which has signaled it would be likely to pursue a policy of engagement with the North. A left-wing government would also place into question the continued deployment in South Korea  of a US missile defense system,  which is bitterly opposed by China.   Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in, of the opposition Democratic United Party, currently leads the opinion polls. Moon was defeated narrowly by Park in 2012.   Chaos on the streets   Soon after the court's ruling, acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn appealed for unity, acknowledging that the conflict had polarized the nation. South Koreans on opposing sides saw each other as \"enemies,\" he said in a televised address. \"Now is the time, however, for acceptance,\" he said.   As the court's decision was delivered, a group of around 100 Park supporters tried to break through police lines near the court, and a number fell and were injured.  \"We lost our liberty. We lost our Korea,\" one protestor told CNN.   READ MORE: What you need to know about the South Korea corruption scandal   Anti-Park demonstrators also took the streets, some crying tears of joy and pumping fists in celebration, as applause rang out from the crowd. Many had camped out in the streets overnight in the cold.    Police had issued the highest level of emergency order possible in Seoul ahead of the announcement. About 21,000 officers were on standby for the protests, with 270 units mobilized.   Fall from grace   Park's election in 2013 as the South Korea's first female president was widely celebrated as a milestone. But her fumbled response to a ferry disaster tainted her rule, and allegations about her relationship to Choi emerged during 2016.    Choi was arrested after being accused of abusing her relationship with the President. She denies claism that she forced companies to donate millions of dollars to foundations she had established.   The case widened to ensnare Lee Jae-yong, the acting head of electronics giant Samsung.   Prosecutors allege that Lee pledged tens of millions of dollars to win favor with Park and secure government support for a merger that helped tighten his grip on the company. He is on trial for charges of bribery and corruption, which he denies.    In December, lawmakers voted to impeach Park by a vote of 234 to 56, stripping away her executive powers. Since then she has remained in the presidential palace, known as the Blue House, but has remained largely out of public view.   Friday's ruling means Park loses the protection from prosecution she enjoyed as president and that she could now face a formal investigation.   Security concerns   Hwang, who became acting President when Park was impeached, warned that North Korea could exploit the political uncertainty.   South Korea's political stability is crucial to the security of the region -- it is a key buttress against North Korea, its provocative neighbor, and a major trading partner with the US and its Asian neighbors.   The US moved quickly to issue a reassuring statement, saying the two countries' relationship would be unaffected.   \"We will continue to work with Prime Minister Hwang for the remainder of his tenure as acting President, and we look forward to a productive relationship with whomever the people of South Korea elect to be their next president,\" acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.   North Korea's official news agency noted that Park had lost her immunity, reporting that she would be investigated as a \"common criminal.\"",

   "content": "(CNN) The  impeachment of President Park Geun-hye  will usher in new leadership that could take a vastly different approach to South Korea-US relations.    Will the next leader in Seoul agree with the United States on key issues including North Korea and the placement of a  US-built missile defense system  on South Korean soil? Or will South Korea favor a shift? Will it seek closer relations with China, its largest trading partner?   State Department spokesman Mark Toner characterized Park's ouster as a \"domestic issue on which the United States takes no position.\" He also stressed the close US ties with South Korea as \"a linchpin of regional stability and security.\"    US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is expected to arrive in Seoul next week.    What comes next   With Park's ouster, South Korea will hold a snap election within 60 days in what is guaranteed be a campaign frenzy. Opinion polls so far show the left-leaning Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012, as the front-runner.   Liberals in South Korea typically favor a more conciliatory approach with Pyongyang, and many oppose the US missile defense system known as the  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD , which is designed to intercept incoming missiles, conceivably from North Korea.   Meanwhile, conservatives such as Park have retained a more hawkish view on North Korea and generally support US policies, including THAAD.    \"If progressives take power, I do think issues like THAAD and North Korea policy could be on the table, which would have huge consequences for the US right now,\" said David Kang, director of the University of Southern California's Korean Studies Institute.    After nine years of conservative leadership and a scandal-marred Park presidency, South Korea may be signaling it's ready for a change. The conservatives lost their majority in a shock defeat in parliamentary elections last year.    New leadership in Seoul could mark a shift on two key issues in US and South Korea relations -- the missile defense system and the position on North Korea.      THAAD and China: It's complicated    The  first pieces of the THAAD defense system  arrived this week in South Korea. The project has been fiercely opposed by China and Russia as a threat to their security.   China has raised significant economic pressure  on South Korea to scrap the defense system through threats to a South Korean retail group and restrictions on Korean products and possibly travel to the country. These have triggered fears of a trade war, which would be crushing for South Korea since trade with China accounts for about a quarter of its exports.   Regardless of the pressure from Beijing, THAAD already has its share of critics within South Korea. Opposition parties have sought a vote on the missile defense system in parliament once the country's political uncertainty is resolved.   South Koreans generally don't want to weaken the alliance with the United States, but if the next leader walks back on THAAD, \"we'd have a real change in the Korean policy toward the US,\" said Kang, who is also the director of the USC Center for International Studies.    Such a scenario would be a win for China and a blow for the United States.   Regardless of political ideology, South Korean presidents have sought better relations with China.    \"Korean politicians, no matter left or right, are more welcoming of China than the Americans would like,\" Kang said.    There's the question of North Korea   North and South Korean relations have remained frosty during the last two conservative presidencies.    \"The South Korean left has been more accommodating of North Korea, more willing to engage. The South Korean right has been more hawkish and more confrontational,\" said Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University's Department of Political Science and Diplomacy.    Liberal presidents have supported engagement with North Korea, including what's known as the  Sunshine Policy  in which Seoul refrained from criticizing Pyongyang's human rights record and struck a more conciliatory tone.    That era from 1998 to 2008 was marked by fractures in the US-Korea alliance.   The Sunshine Policy ended when conservative  President Lee Myung-bak  took power in 2008 and relations on the peninsula have stalled since. Liberal South Korean leaders such as Moon are critical of hard-line policies on North Korea, noting that they have not deterred the isolated regime's weapon testing and nuclear ambitions.    Their belief is that \"engaging and interacting with North Korea is the sole way to change their main foe -- and bring long-term peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula,\"  wrote Booseung Chang, a fellow at the Rand Corp.  \"In their scheme, one key to the success of this strategy is securing cooperation from Beijing. This change goes against existing US strategy toward North Korea and China.\"    But calling for engagement with North Korea may not be so easy given last month's  high-profile assassination of dictator Kim Jong Un's half brother  and  recent missile tests , Kelly said.    \"All this suggests that  North Korea is a pretty serious global menace now , and it'd be really hard for the South Korean left to tell the US that we want to re-engage this country,\" he added.",

   "content": "Two protesters were killed during  violent clashes with police after a South Korean Court removed President Park Geun-hye from office.   Officers threw gas at hundreds of Park's supporters as they tried to breach a police blockade in front of the constitutional court in Seoul today.    One elderly man was taken to hospital with a head injury and the second death is being investigated.   Shocking pictures show supporters of the former president getting into scuffles with police, who formed a human shield to keep the agitators from the court.   While some people stood right in front of the police barricade, one man in a red cap tried to pick a fight with two police officers.    Spectators and fellow demonstrators stood and took pictures of the man as he fought with the police.    Officers also pepper-sprayed pro-Park protesters, who recoiled as they tried to press through the police line.   Demonstrators started hitting buses in the area with large poles as frightened members of the public stood on top of the vehicles and looked on.    Police in riot gear sat on the roof of a bus and deflected the protesters' poles.     Park is the first democratically elected leader of South Korea to be ousted and was impeached because of a corruption scandal.    The court's acting chief judge, Lee Jung-mi, said Park had  violated the constitution and law 'throughout her term', and  despite the objections of parliament and the press, she had  concealed the truth and cracked down on critics.   'The removal of the claimee from office is overwhelmingly to  the benefit of the protection of the constitution. ... We remove  President Park Geun-hye from office,' Lee told the hearing.      A presidential election will be held within 60 days.       Park, 65, no longer has immunity as president, and could now  face criminal charges over bribery, extortion and abuse of power  in connection with allegations of conspiring with her friend,  Choi Soon-sil.    Park was stripped of her powers after parliament voted to  impeach her but has remained in the president's official  compound, the Blue House.    A spokesman said on Friday she would  leave and return to her private home in Seoul.      Park was accused of colluding with her friend, Choi and a  former presidential aide, both of whom have been on trial, to  pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to  back her policy initiatives.   The court said Park had 'completely hidden the fact of  (Choi's) interference with state affairs'.   Park was also accused of soliciting bribes from the head of  the Samsung Group for government favours, including backing a  merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that was seen as  supporting the succession of control over the country's largest  'chaebol' conglomerate.   Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee has been accused of bribery  and embezzlement in connection with the scandal and is in  detention. His trial began on Thursday.   He and Samsung have denied wrongdoing.    While Park's supporters clashed with police outside the  court, elsewhere in the city people welcomed her ouster.    A  recent poll showed more than 70 percent supported her  impeachment.   Police blocked the main thoroughfare running through  downtown Seoul in anticipation of bigger protests.   Prosecutors have named Park as an accomplice in two court  cases linked to the scandal, suggesting she is likely to be  investigated and could face legal proceedings.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn was appointed acting president  and will remain in that post until the election. If Hwang  resigns, as some media have speculated he may to run for  president, the finance minister will take over as acting  president.   The U.S. State Department said it would continue to work  with the acting president and whoever becomes the next  president.   Relations with China and the United States could dominate  the coming presidential campaign, after South Korea this month  deployed the U.S. THAAD missile defence system in response to  North Korea's stepped up missile and nuclear tests.   China has vociferously protested against the deployment,  fearing its sophisticated radar could see into its own missile  deployments.   North Korean state media denounced Park as a criminal.   'She had one more year left as 'president' but, now she's  been ousted, she will be investigated as a common criminal,' the  North's state KCNA news agency said.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office in a unanimous ruling Friday over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide.   The decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader, who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   Two people died during protests that followed the ruling. Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.   The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park has not made a public statement on her removal.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.   An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.   In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   Since Park is no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, who was recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Hwang has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park has not made a public statement on her removal.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored.

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office in a unanimous ruling Friday over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide.   The decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader, who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   Two people died during protests that followed the ruling. Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.   The ruling allows possible criminal proceedings against the 65-year-old Park \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview her.   Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park has not made a public statement on her removal.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.   An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.   In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   Since Park is no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, who was recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Hwang has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.   The ruling opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big.

Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The ruling opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview with her.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn't planning any statement on Friday, it said.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor.

Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal.

The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation.

But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South.

Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The ruling opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview with her.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn't planning any statement on Friday, it said.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since Park is no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, who was recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Hwang has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">__</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>",

   "content": "Seoul (CNN) Park Geun-hye's story is South Korea's history.    The first  South Korean president to be impeached , Park spent both her youth and later years in the Blue House. A life in the spotlight rich in tragedy and scandal.    Park first moved to the presidential quarters aged 10, when her father, Park Chung-hee, seized power in a military coup in 1961. He rewrote the constitution to cement his grip on power and brutally cracked down on dissent and opposition, leading many to call him a dictator.    Supporters though saw the older Park as a hero, who rebuilt the country's economy and standing from the ashes of the Korean War.    First Daughter   In 1974, Park's mother was killed in a botched assassination attempt on her father. In the years that followed, she assumed the role of First Lady, greeting world leaders alongside her father. This was Park's first training on how to lead her country.    \"With the sudden passing of my mother ... heavy responsibilities and duties of the First Lady were suddenly forced upon me, it was indeed an arduous task,\" she told CNN in 2014.    Five years after her mother's death, Park Chung-hee was also assassinated -- killed by his own security chief. Having lost both her parents and her home, Park withdrew from the public sphere, living what she described as \"a very normal life.\"    Park said she was persuaded to rejoin politics after seeing the effects of the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s. Even with her pedigree, however, the road to political power was far from easy. In 2006, she was attacked while campaigning ahead of local elections in Seoul, but continued in politics, eventually winning the Presidency and returning to the Blue House in 2013, decades after her parents' deaths.    Disaster   Park became the first female leader of a deeply patriarchal South Korean society, sparking hopes of a push toward gender equality. Her performance on the job reminded some of her father.    \"According to her aides, her style of governing was more reminiscent of (Park Chung-hee), more authoritarian than South Korea's used to in today's 21st century democracy,\" said Duyeon Kim of Georgetown University.    Just over a year into her presidency, tragedy struck again.    On April 16, 2014, a passenger ferry  sank off the coast of South Korea.  As the country watched live broadcasts in horror, hundreds of passengers -- most of them high school students on a field trip to the holiday island of Jeju -- drowned.    In all,  304 people died , and it quickly became clear that the ferry's sinking was a man-made disaster of corruption and incompetence. Park did not address the nation until  seven hours after the tragedy began.     \"That was a stain on her presidency,\" said John Delury, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University. \"There was a palpable sense at that time that she wasn't there. It's not as if people expected her to magically save the ship, but there was a need for leadership.\"   Corruption   \"I believe that one should value and place the utmost value on trust and confidence,\" Park told CNN before the Sewol disaster.    But if the ferry's sinking shook public confidence in the president, a  massive corruption scandal which began unfolding last year  -- gripping the nation and paralyzing the country's politics -- was the final straw for millions of Koreans.    Since the death of Park's mother, questions had been raised about the influence of a cult leader, Choi Tae-min, on the young First Daughter.    A confidential 2007 US diplomatic cable,  published by Wikileaks , referenced rumors that Choi had \"complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.\"   In October, it emerged that one of those children, Choi Soon-sil, had the trust and ear of Park the president, and had for decades.    Choi is currently on trial for meddling in state affairs and extorting money. She denies all charges against her.    Following a three month investigation by special prosecutors, it was recommended that Park be indicted as a bribery suspect once she loses presidential immunity.    Calls for Park's impeachment were swift after she made a short televised apology, in which it was made clear she would not step down as she did not believe she had done anything wrong.    Hundreds of thousands of people protested in downtown Seoul every Saturday throughout the brutally cold Korean winter, opposed by much smaller demonstrations calling for Park to remain.    Subsequent apologies from Park fell largely on deaf ears, and months of political stalemate and divisive public protests continued.    On Friday, a   unanimous decision by the country's Constitutional Court ended Park's presidency for good, upholding a vote by the National Assembly to impeach her.    Elections for a new leader must be held in the next 60 days and Park's Saenuri Party hopes to maintain their grip on power despite the scandal.    But the woman who spent much of her life in and out of the Blue House will have to leave it again, this time for good.",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><cite class=\"el-editorial-source\">Seoul (CNN)</cite>Park Geun-hye's story is South Korea's history. </p> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The first <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2017/03/09/asia/south-korea-president-park-constitutional-court/index.html\">South Korean president to be impeached</a>, Park spent both her youth and later years in the Blue House. A life in the spotlight rich in tragedy and scandal. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Park first moved to the presidential quarters aged 10, when her father, Park Chung-hee, seized power in a military coup in 1961. He rewrote the constitution to cement his grip on power and brutally cracked down on dissent and opposition, leading many to call him a dictator. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Supporters though saw the older Park as a hero, who rebuilt the country's economy and standing from the ashes of the Korean War. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>First Daughter</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 1974, Park's mother was killed in a botched assassination attempt on her father. In the years that followed, she assumed the role of First Lady, greeting world leaders alongside her father. This was Park's first training on how to lead her country. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"With the sudden passing of my mother ... heavy responsibilities and duties of the First Lady were suddenly forced upon me, it was indeed an arduous task,\" she told CNN in 2014. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Five years after her mother's death, Park Chung-hee was also assassinated -- killed by his own security chief. Having lost both her parents and her home, Park withdrew from the public sphere, living what she described as \"a very normal life.\" </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Park said she was persuaded to rejoin politics after seeing the effects of the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s. Even with her pedigree, however, the road to political power was far from easy. In 2006, she was attacked while campaigning ahead of local elections in Seoul, but continued in politics, eventually winning the Presidency and returning to the Blue House in 2013, decades after her parents' deaths. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>Disaster</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Park became the first female leader of a deeply patriarchal South Korean society, sparking hopes of a push toward gender equality. Her performance on the job reminded some of her father. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"According to her aides, her style of governing was more reminiscent of (Park Chung-hee), more authoritarian than South Korea's used to in today's 21st century democracy,\" said Duyeon Kim of Georgetown University. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Just over a year into her presidency, tragedy struck again. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On April 16, 2014, a passenger ferry <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2014/05/15/world/asia/sewol-problems/\">sank off the coast of South Korea. </a>As the country watched live broadcasts in horror, hundreds of passengers -- most of them high school students on a field trip to the holiday island of Jeju -- drowned. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In all, <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2016/04/14/asia/sewol-recovery-plan/\">304 people died</a>, and it quickly became clear that the ferry's sinking was a man-made disaster of corruption and incompetence. Park did not address the nation until <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/south-korea-parliament-probes-park-missing-hours-161214053758532.html\" target=\"_blank\">seven hours after the tragedy began.</a> </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"That was a stain on her presidency,\" said John Delury, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University. \"There was a palpable sense at that time that she wasn't there. It's not as if people expected her to magically save the ship, but there was a need for leadership.\"</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>Corruption</h3></div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I believe that one should value and place the utmost value on trust and confidence,\" Park told CNN before the Sewol disaster. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But if the ferry's sinking shook public confidence in the president, a <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2016/11/02/asia/south-korea-president-scandal-explained/\">massive corruption scandal which began unfolding last year</a> -- gripping the nation and paralyzing the country's politics -- was the final straw for millions of Koreans. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Since the death of Park's mother, questions had been raised about the influence of a cult leader, Choi Tae-min, on the young First Daughter. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A confidential 2007 US diplomatic cable, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SEOUL2178_a.html\" target=\"_blank\">published by Wikileaks</a>, referenced rumors that Choi had \"complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.\"</div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In October, it emerged that one of those children, Choi Soon-sil, had the trust and ear of Park the president, and had for decades. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Choi is currently on trial for meddling in state affairs and extorting money. She denies all charges against her. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Following a three month investigation by special prosecutors, it was recommended that Park be indicted as a bribery suspect once she loses presidential immunity. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Calls for Park's impeachment were swift after she made a short televised apology, in which it was made clear she would not step down as she did not believe she had done anything wrong. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Hundreds of thousands of people protested in downtown Seoul every Saturday throughout the brutally cold Korean winter, opposed by much smaller demonstrations calling for Park to remain. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Subsequent apologies from Park fell largely on deaf ears, and months of political stalemate and divisive public protests continued. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Friday, a<strong> </strong>unanimous decision by the country's Constitutional Court ended Park's presidency for good, upholding a vote by the National Assembly to impeach her. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Elections for a new leader must be held in the next 60 days and Park's Saenuri Party hopes to maintain their grip on power despite the scandal. </div> <div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the woman who spent much of her life in and out of the Blue House will have to leave it again, this time for good. </div> <p class=\"zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer\"></p>",

   "content": "(CNN) Hundreds of \"blacklisted\" artists purportedly critical of the administration of the now-impeached South Korean President are fighting back, with a plan to file a lawsuit against the embattled premier and her government.   The Republic of Korea, President Park Guen-hye and other government officials are to be sued, according to a statement by MINBYUN-Lawyers for a Democratic Society, among the attorneys representing the plaintiffs.   The group of lawyers, whose name translated into English from Korean means \"Legal Counteraction Group for President Park Administration's Cultural, Art industry Blacklist Crisis,\" has so far recruited 474 plaintiffs from among the almost 10,000 artists on the list.    A spokesman for the special prosecutor's office, Lee Kyu-chul, said that the cultural ministry banned artists on this list from receiving government funds.   The names of the artists on the blacklist have not been made public, although a leaked document included prominent, award-winning Korean writers.   The statement comes a day after South Korea's special prosecutor indicted two former members of Park's government -- former culture minister Cho Yoon-sun and former presidential chief of staff, Kim Ki-choon -- on charges of abuse of power, coercion, and perjury in relation to their involvement in the drafting of the so-called blacklist.    Both have denied all charges, according to the spokesman, Lee.  Cho and Kim will be listed as defendants in the lawsuit, the statement said.   29 lawmakers quit South Korean President's party amid scandal   Impeachment   After weeks of protest, South Korea's parliament voted on December 9 to impeach Park over improprieties related to her informal adviser and friend, Choi Soon-Sil's role in her government. The impeachment proceedings are expected to last through the month.    She may be questioned by special prosecutors later this week -- the first sitting president to be questioned in this way -- but could refuse.   Details of the indictments were not disclosed, senior prosecutor Lee Kyu-Chul said, as his office still needs to question Park and Choi.   \"Charges related to Park Geun-Hye and Choi Soon-Sil are included in their indictments, but detailed instructions cannot be revealed now,\" Lee said.     Cho and Kim join the former minister's predecessor, Kim Jong-deok, who was indicted on the same charges on January 30. Former first vice cultural minister Jung Kwan-joo and Park's former presidential aide Shin Dong-churl have also been indicted in relation to the so-called blacklist.   Kim's trial is ongoing, and during hearings for Park's impeachment, he said that this list was already existent when he came to office at the ministry.    South Korea scandal: Choi Soon-sil's daughter arrested in Denmark   Protests, a president's ouster   South Korea's political class finished last year in turmoil after allegations emerged that Park had allowed Choi, her confidante, who was not a member of government, access to classified documents despite her unofficial status.    Choi is also accused of intervening in state affairs, and massive protests late last year led to Park's impeachment and Choi's arrest.    Choi was a friend and informal adviser to South Korean President Park Geun-hye, and has been described as a  Rasputin-like character  to the leader.   She is  on trial on charges of abuse of power and attempted fraud  following the accusations she had access to secret government documents.   CNN's Sol Han and journalist Seo Yoon-jung contributed to this report.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office in a unanimous ruling Friday over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide.   The decision capped a stunning fall for the country's first female leader, who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   Two people died during protests that followed the ruling. Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.   The ruling opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview with her.   Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn't planning any statement on Friday, it said.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.   An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.   In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   Since Park is no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, who was recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Hwang has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the violent clashes near the court, which prompted Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's acting head of state, to plead for peace and urge Park's angry supporters to move on.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The ruling opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' security alliance.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee accused Park of colluding with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi, a private citizen, meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those allegations were previously made by prosecutors, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview with her.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn't planning any statement on Friday, it said.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters with plastic flag poles and steel ladders, and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In a televised speech, Hwang said \"there would be people who feel they cannot understand or accept (the court ruling), but it's now time to move on and end all conflict and standoff.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since Park is no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, who was recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Hwang has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">__</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 With South Korea's Constitutional Court stripping President Park Geun-hye of power, the country slips into a political whirlwind building up to a presidential election likely in early May.   Here's a look at possible scenarios in the frantic weeks ahead and some of the potential presidential contenders vying for the presidential Blue House:   ___   INTO THE FIRE   With Park now formally unseated, the country, by law, must hold a presidential by-election within 60 days. This means the vote will likely take place on May 9.   The winner of the election will be immediately sworn in as the country's leader, according to South Korea's National Election Commission.   Without the luxury of having a presidential transition committee, the new president will have to rely on Park's presidential aides and Cabinet ministers, at least in the first few weeks, before piecing together a new government.   There's also a possibility that the presidential race could unfold while Park is being interrogated by prosecutors over suspicions that she conspired with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.   Prosecutors have already identified Park as a criminal suspect and now can now make a stronger push for indictment as she no longer has immunity from prosecution. Their investigations have already led to many arrests of former government officials, presidential aides and a globally famous tycoon, Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong, who is accused of bribing Park and her friend in exchange for business favors.   Park repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors in recent months, but that will be harder to do now because prosecutors can get an arrest warrant.   Being dragged into a criminal court, and possibly serving time in jail, would mark a shocking downfall for Park, who defeated her liberal opponent in the 2012 election with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who fondly remembered her dictator father as a hero.   ___   BATTLE OF THE LIBERALS   Many conservatives are seen as toxic because of their past association with Park, so some political pundits believe South Korea's next leader will be determined in the primaries of the liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the country's opposition parties.   And the party's two leading presidential contenders have remarkably different tones on major issues, including the country's approach to belligerent North Korea.   Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012 but is now the clear presidential favorite, argues that Seoul should pursue dialogue, not just the use of sanctions, to try to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. He vows to reopen an industrial park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong that was jointly run by the Koreas before Park's government closed it last year following a nuclear test and long-range rocket launch by the North.   Moon has also shown a willingness to challenge the United States, the country's main ally, saying Seoul should reconsider its plans to deploy THAAD, an advanced U.S. anti-missile system, to cope with North Korean threats. Moon argues that THAAD's security benefits would be curtailed by worsened relations with China and Russia, which see the system's powerful radar as a threat.   Moon's strongest challenger in the primaries will likely be An Heejung, the centrist governor of South Chungcheong Province.   An says it would be difficult for South Korea's next government to reopen the Kaesong park when Seoul has to stay committed to international sanctions to punish the North over its nuclear ambitions. He also supports the need for THAAD. An's stance has won him the support of many conservatives disappointed by Park.   ___   CONSERVATIVE DISARRAY   The political turmoil surrounding Park has complicated politics for her conservative Liberty Korea Party, which failed to prevent the defection of dozens of lawmakers who created a new party for the presidential elections.   Some party members have hinted at presidential ambitions, including South Gyeongsang Province Governor Hong Joonpyo, but polls show their support to be closer to zero than 5 percent.   Things are not much better for the Bareun Party, consisting of those who defected from the Liberty Korea Party. Bareun had hoped to lure former United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon as its presidential candidate, but was left reeling after Ban abruptly decided he wouldn't run.   Bareun's flag-bearer may end up being Yoo Seong-min, a one-time Park aide who later became a critic. A recent poll by Gallup Korea showed Yoo's support at 1 percent.   The best hope for conservatives to win back the Blue House might be Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who has been the country's acting head of state since lawmakers passed an impeachment motion against Park in December.   Hwang has never declared an ambition to run for president, but has never outright denied interest either.   Recent polls show Hwang's support at about 10 to 15 percent in opinion polls. That would leave him still behind Moon, whose support has consistently been in the mid-30s.   If Hwang enters the presidential race, the role of government caretaker will go to Deputy Prime Minister Yoo Il-ho until the elections.",

This means the vote will likely take place on May 9.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The winner of the election will be immediately sworn in as the country's leader, according to South Korea's National Election Commission.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Without the luxury of having a presidential transition committee, the new president will have to rely on Park's presidential aides and Cabinet ministers, at least in the first few weeks, before piecing together a new government.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">There's also a possibility that the presidential race could unfold while Park is being interrogated by prosecutors over suspicions that she conspired with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have already identified Park as a criminal suspect and now can now make a stronger push for indictment as she no longer has immunity from prosecution. Their investigations have already led to many arrests of former government officials, presidential aides and a globally famous tycoon, Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong, who is accused of bribing Park and her friend in exchange for business favors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors in recent months, but that will be harder to do now because prosecutors can get an arrest warrant.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Being dragged into a criminal court, and possibly serving time in jail, would mark a shocking downfall for Park, who defeated her liberal opponent in the 2012 election with overwhelming support from older South Koreans, who fondly remembered her dictator father as a hero.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">BATTLE OF THE LIBERALS</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Many conservatives are seen as toxic because of their past association with Park, so some political pundits believe South Korea's next leader will be determined in the primaries of the liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the country's opposition parties.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">And the party's two leading presidential contenders have remarkably different tones on major issues, including the country's approach to belligerent North Korea.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in 2012 but is now the clear presidential favorite, argues that Seoul should pursue dialogue, not just the use of sanctions, to try to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. He vows to reopen an industrial park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong that was jointly run by the Koreas before Park's government closed it last year following a nuclear test and long-range rocket launch by the North.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Moon has also shown a willingness to challenge the United States, the country's main ally, saying Seoul should reconsider its plans to deploy THAAD, an advanced U.S. anti-missile system, to cope with North Korean threats. Moon argues that THAAD's security benefits would be curtailed by worsened relations with China and Russia, which see the system's powerful radar as a threat.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Moon's strongest challenger in the primaries will likely be An Heejung, the centrist governor of South Chungcheong Province.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">An says it would be difficult for South Korea's next government to reopen the Kaesong park when Seoul has to stay committed to international sanctions to punish the North over its nuclear ambitions. He also supports the need for THAAD. An's stance has won him the support of many conservatives disappointed by Park.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">CONSERVATIVE DISARRAY</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The political turmoil surrounding Park has complicated politics for her conservative Liberty Korea Party, which failed to prevent the defection of dozens of lawmakers who created a new party for the presidential elections.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some party members have hinted at presidential ambitions, including South Gyeongsang Province Governor Hong Joonpyo, but polls show their support to be closer to zero than 5 percent.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Things are not much better for the Bareun Party, consisting of those who defected from the Liberty Korea Party. Bareun had hoped to lure former United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon as its presidential candidate, but was left reeling after Ban abruptly decided he wouldn't run.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Bareun's flag-bearer may end up being Yoo Seong-min, a one-time Park aide who later became a critic. A recent poll by Gallup Korea showed Yoo's support at 1 percent.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The best hope for conservatives to win back the Blue House might be Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who has been the country's acting head of state since lawmakers passed an impeachment motion against Park in December.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Hwang has never declared an ambition to run for president, but has never outright denied interest either.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Recent polls show Hwang's support at about 10 to 15 percent in opinion polls. That would leave him still behind Moon, whose support has consistently been in the mid-30s.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">If Hwang enters the presidential race, the role of government caretaker will go to Deputy Prime Minister Yoo Il-ho until the elections.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Formally removed from office by a historic Constitutional Court ruling Friday, Park Geun-hye has lost her presidential immunity from prosecution over a corruption scandal that has sent dozens of high-profile figures to face criminal trials.   They include Park's friend of 40 years, Choi Soon-sil, Samsung's de-facto leader Lee Jae-yong, top presidential advisers, two former culture ministers and a music video director. Their charges include bribery, extortion, abuse of power and perjury.   A look at the allegations facing Park, and the key criminal defendants caught up in a scandal that has roiled South Korea for months.   ___   PARK GEUN-HYE   Park has refused to undergo prosecutors' questioning, citing a law that provides a sitting leader with immunity from prosecution except for grave crimes like treason. But now that she's a former president, Park is stripped of that privilege and will likely face a direct investigation.   Prosecutors have accused Park of colluding with Choi to pressure 16 companies to donate a total of 77.4 billion won ($66.7 million) for the launch of two foundations controlled by Choi. They also allege that Park, along with Choi, took millions of dollars in bribes from Samsung's Lee, who is accused of seeking government support to strengthen his control over the business empire.   Park is also accused of conspiring with Choi and top officials to draw up of a blacklist of cultural figures critical of her policies to deny them state support.   Prosecutors also believe Park had one of her presidential aides convey dozens of documents with state secrets to Choi.   Park has acknowledged that she got help from Choi to edit some of her speeches. But she denies legal wrongdoing.   ___   CHOI SOON-SIL   Choi has been arrested and charged with abuse of power, extortion and attempted fraud. If convicted on all charges, she could receive up to 15 years in prison.   Choi has acknowledged that she received some of Park's speech drafts in advance but didn't know they included sensitive information. She denies other allegations.   Choi is also charged with pressuring Hyundai Motors and the KT telecommunication firm to sign $6 million and $5.7 million worth of ad contracts, respectively, with Playground, an ad agency she ran.   She also faces charges that she pushed Hyundai to buy $930,450 worth of car components from a company owned by an acquaintance.   ___   LEE JAE-YONG   The 48-year-old Samsung Electronics vice chairman faces bribery, embezzlement and three other charges punishable by at least five years in prison if he's proven guilty. A team of Samsung lawyers denied all charges against Lee during a preliminary court hearing Thursday.   Prosecutors allege that Lee and his aides used Samsung corporate funds to buy expensive horses for Choi's daughter. According to prosecutors, Samsung allegedly gave or promised 43.3 billion won ($38 million) to four entities controlled by Choi.   Prosecutors allege the money was given to obtain government backing for a contentious merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 that served as a key step in passing corporate control to Lee from his ailing father.   ___   AHN JONG-BEOM   Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, Ahn was allegedly involved with Choi in extorting money from 16 companies at Park's order. He is charged with extortion, abuse of power and bribery.   ___   JUNG HO-SUNG   Jung is one of Park's close associates and worked for her since she entered politics in the late 1990s. He's been charged with passing on classified presidential documents to Choi, including information on ministerial candidates.   ___   CHO YOON-SUN   Park's culture minister, Cho, was arrested and indicted over the blacklist allegations. She became the first incumbent Cabinet member to be arrested over the scandal, and quickly resigned. Former Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok and ex-presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon were also indicted over the blacklist.   ___   CHA EUN-TAEK   A well-known music video director, Cha is on trial for allegedly using his close ties with Choi to win key culture-related projects from government agencies.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 In a historic, unanimous ruling Friday, South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide.   It capped a stunning fall for Park, the country's first female leader who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   The ruling by the eight-member panel opens her up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from perennial rival North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' decades-long security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand for any protests, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   The government put South Korea's military and police on heightened alert after the court decision. There were no immediate reports of unusual activities by North Korea's military, which faces nearby Seoul across the world's most heavily armed border.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers with plastic flag poles and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.   \"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"   Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes.   Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.   Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won't be difficult.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy.   But her father was also a burden, as many here remember him as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father's high-handed style.   \"The nostalgia for Park Chung-hee's developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the '60s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye's impeachment,\" said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \"When people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn't do so because of her.\"   Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on the issue of public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing.   The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \"when I had difficulties\" in the past. Park and Choi had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016, and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand for any protests, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The government put South Korea's military and police on heightened alert after the court decision. There were no immediate reports of unusual activities by North Korea's military, which faces nearby Seoul across the world's most heavily armed border.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers with plastic flag poles and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won't be difficult.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">But her father was also a burden, as many here remember him as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father's high-handed style.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"The nostalgia for Park Chung-hee's developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the '60s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye's impeachment,\" said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \"When people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn't do so because of her.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on the issue of public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \"when I had difficulties\" in the past. Park and Choi had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016, and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">__</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Formally removed from office by a historic Constitutional Court ruling Friday, Park Geun-hye has lost her presidential immunity from prosecution over a corruption scandal that has sent dozens of high-profile figures to face criminal trials.   Those include Park's friend of 40 years Choi Soon-sil, Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, top presidential advisers, two former culture ministers and a music video director. Their charges include bribery, extortion, abuse of power and perjury.   Here's a look at the allegations facing Park, and the key criminal defendants caught up in a scandal that has roiled South Korea for months.   __   PARK GEUN-HYE   Park has refused to undergo prosecutors' questioning, citing a law that provides a sitting leader with immunity from prosecution except for grave crimes like treason. But since she's now a former president, Park is stripped of that privilege and will likely face a direct investigation.   Prosecutors have accused Park of colluding with Choi to pressure 16 companies to donate a total of 77.4 billion won ($66.7 million) for the launch of two foundations controlled by Choi. They also allege that Park, along with Choi, took millions of dollars in bribes from Samsung's Lee, who sought the government's support to strengthen his control over the business empire.   Park is also accused of conspiring with Choi and top officials to draw up of a \"blacklist\" of cultural figures critical of her government policies to deny them state support.   Prosecutors also believe Park had one of her presidential aides convey dozens of documents with state secrets to Choi.   Park has acknowledged that she got help from Choi to edit some of her speeches. But she denies legal wrongdoing.   __   CHOI SOON-SIL   Choi has been arrested and charged with abuse of power, extortion and attempted fraud. If convicted on all charges, she could receive up to 15 years in prison, according to court officials.   Choi has acknowledged that she received some of Park's speech drafts in advance but didn't know they included sensitive information. She denies other allegations.   Choi is also charged with pressuring Hyundai Motors and the KT telecommunication firm to sign $6 million and $5.7 million worth of ad contracts, respectively, with Playground, an ad agency she ran.   She also faces charges that she pushed Hyundai to buy $930,450 worth of car components from a company owned by an acquaintance.   __   LEE JAE-YONG   The 48-year-old Samsung Electronics vice chairman faces bribery, embezzlement and three other charges punishable by at least five years in prison if he's proven guilty. A team of Samsung lawyers denied all charges against Lee during a preliminary court hearing Thursday.   Prosecutors allege that Lee and his aides used Samsung corporate funds to buy expensive horses for Choi's daughter. According to prosecutors, Samsung allegedly gave or promised to give 43.3 billion won ($38 million) to four entities controlled by Choi.   Prosecutors allege the money was given to obtain government backing for a contentious merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 that served as a key step in passing corporate control to Lee from his ailing father.   __   AHN JONG-BEOM   Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, Ahn was allegedly involved in the extortion of money from the 16 companies with Choi at the order of Park.

Those include Park's friend of 40 years Choi Soon-sil, Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, top presidential advisers, two former culture ministers and a music video director. Their charges include bribery, extortion, abuse of power and perjury.   Here's a look at the allegations facing Park, and the key criminal defendants caught up in a scandal that has roiled South Korea for months.   __   PARK GEUN-HYE   Park has refused to undergo prosecutors' questioning, citing a law that provides a sitting leader with immunity from prosecution except for grave crimes like treason. But since she's now a former president, Park is stripped of that privilege and will likely face a direct investigation.

They also allege that Park, along with Choi, took millions of dollars in bribes from Samsung's Lee, who sought the government's support to strengthen his control over the business empire.   Park is also accused of conspiring with Choi and top officials to draw up of a \"blacklist\" of cultural figures critical of her government policies to deny them state support.   Prosecutors also believe Park had one of her presidential aides convey dozens of documents with state secrets to Choi.

She also faces charges that she pushed Hyundai to buy $930,450 worth of car components from a company owned by an acquaintance.   __   LEE JAE-YONG   The 48-year-old Samsung Electronics vice chairman faces bribery, embezzlement and three other charges punishable by at least five years in prison if he's proven guilty. A team of Samsung lawyers denied all charges against Lee during a preliminary court hearing Thursday.

Prosecutors allege that Lee and his aides used Samsung corporate funds to buy expensive horses for Choi's daughter. According to prosecutors, Samsung allegedly gave or promised 43.3 billion won ($38 million) to four entities controlled by Choi.

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 In a historic, unanimous ruling Friday, South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil, worsened an already-serious national divide and prompted calls for sweeping reforms.   It was a stunning fall for Park, the country's first female leader and the daughter of a dictator who rode a lingering conservative nostalgia for her father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency descend into scandal.   The ruling by the eight-member panel opens her up to possible criminal proceedings, and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy came in the country in the late 1980s.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   South Korea must hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. Whoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand for any protests, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.   \"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"   Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes.   Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives.   Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won't be difficult.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy.   But her father was also a burden because there are many who remember the senior Park as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father's high-handed style.   \"The nostalgia for Park Chung-hee's developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the '60s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye's impeachment,\" said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \"When people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn't do so because of her.\"   Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on the issue of public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing.   The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \"when I had difficulties\" in the past. The two women had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016 and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for presidency as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he should resign to run and a deputy prime minister will serve as another interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. Whoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand for any protests, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won't be difficult.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">But her father was also a burden because there are many who remember the senior Park as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father's high-handed style.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"The nostalgia for Park Chung-hee's developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the '60s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye's impeachment,\" said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \"When people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn't do so because of her.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on the issue of public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \"when I had difficulties\" in the past. The two women had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016 and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for presidency as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he should resign to run and a deputy prime minister will serve as another interim leader.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">__</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>",

The Constitutional Court formally removed the impeached Park from office Friday over a corruption scandal.   State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the U.S. will continue to work with the acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, and looks forward to whomever South Koreans choose in a presidential election to be held within two months.   Toner says Park's removal is \"a domestic issue on which the United States takes no position,\" and that it's up to the South Korean people to determine their country's future.   He says the two nations' alliance \"will continue to be a linchpin of regional stability and security.\"",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 In a historic ruling Friday, South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil, worsened an already-serious national divide and led to calls for sweeping reforms.   It was a stunning fall for Park, the daughter of a dictator who rode a lingering conservative nostalgia for her father to a big win in 2012, only to see her presidency descend into scandal. The unanimous ruling opens her up to possible criminal proceedings, and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed early from office since democracy came in the country in the late 1980s.   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. Whoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.   \"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"   Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean court ousted the president on Friday, a first in the nation\u2019s history, rattling the delicate balance of relationships across Asia at  a particularly tense time .   Her removal capped months of turmoil, as hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets, week after week,  to protest a sprawling corruption scandal  that shook the top echelons of business and government.   Park Geun-hye , the nation\u2019s first female president and the daughter of the Cold War military dictator Park Chung-hee, had been an icon of the conservative establishment that joined Washington in pressing for a hard line against North Korea\u2019s nuclear provocations.   Now, her downfall is expected to shift South Korean politics to the opposition, whose leaders want more engagement with North Korea and are wary of a major confrontation in the region. They say they will re-examine the country\u2019s joint strategy on North Korea with the United States and defuse tensions with China, which has sounded alarms about the growing American military footprint in Asia.   Ms. Park\u2019s powers  were suspended in December  after a legislative impeachment vote, though she continued to live in the presidential Blue House, largely alone and hidden from public view, while awaiting the decision by the Constitutional Court. The house had been her childhood home: She first moved in at the age of 9 and left it an orphan nearly two decades later after her mother and father were assassinated in separate episodes.   With the immunity conferred by her office now gone, Ms. Park, 65, faces prosecutors seeking to charge her with bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with a confidante, her childhood friend Choi Soon-sil, to collect tens of millions of dollars in bribes from big businesses like Samsung.   By law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days. The acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, an ally of Ms. Park\u2019s, will remain in office in the interim. The Trump administration is rushing  a missile defense system  to  South Korea  so that it can be in place before the election.   The last time a South Korean leader was removed from office under popular pressure was in 1960, when the police fired on crowds calling for President Syngman Rhee to step down. ( Mr. Rhee, a dictator, fled into exile in Hawaii and died there .)   In a sign of how far South Korea\u2019s young democracy has evolved, Ms. Park was removed without any violence, after large, peaceful protests in recent months demanding that she step down. In addition to the swell of popular anger, the legislature and the judiciary \u2014 two institutions that have been weaker than the presidency historically \u2014 were crucial to the outcome.   \u201cThis is a miracle, a new milestone in the strengthening and institutionalizing of democracy in South Korea,\u201d said Kang Won-taek, a political scientist at Seoul National University.   When crowds took to the streets, they were not just seeking to remove a leader who had one year left in office. They were also rebelling against a political order that had held South Korea together for decades but is now fracturing under pressures both at home and abroad, analysts said.   Ms. Park\u2019s father ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979. He founded its economic growth model, which transformed the nation into an export powerhouse and allowed the emergence of family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol that benefited from tax cuts, anti-labor policies and other benefits from the government.   Ms. Park was elected in 2012  with the support of older conservative South Koreans who revered her father for the country\u2019s breakneck economic growth.   But the nexus of industry and political power gave rise to collusive ties, highlighted by the scandal that led to Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment.   The scandal also swept up the  de facto head of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong , who was indicted on charges of bribing Ms. Park and her confidante, Ms. Choi.   Samsung, the nation\u2019s largest conglomerate, has been tainted by corruption before. But the company has been considered too important to the economy for any of its top leaders to spend time behind bars \u2014 until now. The jailing of Mr. Lee, who is facing trial, is another potent sign that the old order is not holding.   In the wake of the Park scandal, all political parties have vowed to curtail presidential power to pardon chaebol tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes. They also promised to stop chaebol chairmen from helping their children amass fortunes through dubious means, like forcing their companies to do exclusive business with the children\u2019s businesses.   With the conservatives discredited \u2014 and no leading conservative candidate to succeed Ms. Park \u2014 the left could take power for the first time in a decade.   The dominant campaign issues will probably be North Korea\u2019s  nuclear weapons  program and South Korea\u2019s relations with the United States and China.   If the opposition takes power, it may try to revive its old \u201csunshine policy\u201d of building ties with North Korea through aid and exchanges, an approach favored by China. That would complicate Washington\u2019s efforts to isolate the North at a time other Asian nations like the Philippines are gravitating toward Beijing.   Moon Jae-in , the Democratic Party leader who is leading in opinion surveys, has said that a decade of applying sanctions on North Korea has failed to stop its nuclear weapons programs. He has said that sanctions are necessary, but that \u201ctheir goal should be to draw North Korea back to the negotiating table.\u201d   He believes that Ms. Park\u2019s decision to allow the  deployment of the American missile defense system  \u2014 known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad \u2014 has dragged the country into the dangerous and growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing; China has called the system a threat to its own security and taken steps to punish South Korea economically for accepting it.   Conservative South Koreans see the deployment of the antimissile system not only as a guard against the North but also as a symbolic reaffirmation of the all-important alliance with the United States. Mr. Moon\u2019s party demands that the deployment, which began this week, be suspended immediately. If it takes power, it says it will review the deployment of the antimissile system to determine if it is in South Korea\u2019s best interest.   As South Korea has learned in painful fashion, it cannot always keep Washington and Beijing happy at the same time, as in the case of the country\u2019s decision to deploy the American missile defense system.   Yet Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment was also a pushback against \u201cCold War conservatives\u201d like her father, who seized on Communist threats from North Korea to silence political opponents and hide their corruption, said Kim Dong-choon, a sociologist at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.   Ms. Park\u2019s father tortured and even executed dissidents, framing them with spying charges. Now, his daughter faces charges that her government  blacklisted thousands of unfriendly artists and writers , branding them pro-North Korean, and denied them access to government support programs.   \u201cHer removal means that the curtain is finally drawing on the authoritarian political and economic order that has dominated South Korea for decades,\u201d said Ahn Byong-jin, rector of the Global Academy for Future Civilizations at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.   Analysts cautioned that political and economic change will come slowly.   As Mr. Moon put it recently: \u201cWe need a national cleanup. We need to liquidate the old system and build a new South Korea. Only then can we complete the revolution started by the people who rallied with candlelight.\u201d",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"199\" data-total-count=\"199\">SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean court ousted the president on Friday, a first in the nation\u2019s history, rattling the delicate balance of relationships across Asia at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/asia/thaad-missile-defense-us-south-korea-china.html\">a particularly tense time</a>.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"215\" data-total-count=\"414\">Her removal capped months of turmoil, as hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets, week after week, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html\">to protest a sprawling corruption scandal</a> that shook the top echelons of business and government.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"267\" data-total-count=\"681\"><a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/park_geunhye/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Park Geun-hye.\" class=\"meta-per\">Park Geun-hye</a>, the nation\u2019s first female president and the daughter of the Cold War military dictator Park Chung-hee, had been an icon of the conservative establishment that joined Washington in pressing for a hard line against North Korea\u2019s nuclear provocations.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"395\" data-total-count=\"1076\">Now, her downfall is expected to shift South Korean politics to the opposition, whose leaders want more engagement with North Korea and are wary of a major confrontation in the region. They say they will re-examine the country\u2019s joint strategy on North Korea with the United States and defuse tensions with China, which has sounded alarms about the growing American military footprint in Asia.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"434\" data-total-count=\"1510\">Ms. Park\u2019s powers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">were suspended in December</a> after a legislative impeachment vote, though she continued to live in the presidential Blue House, largely alone and hidden from public view, while awaiting the decision by the Constitutional Court. The house had been her childhood home: She first moved in at the age of 9 and left it an orphan nearly two decades later after her mother and father were assassinated in separate episodes.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"331\" data-total-count=\"1841\" id=\"story-continues-2\">With the immunity conferred by her office now gone, Ms. Park, 65, faces prosecutors seeking to charge her with bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with a confidante, her childhood friend Choi Soon-sil, to collect tens of millions of dollars in bribes from big businesses like Samsung.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"286\" data-total-count=\"2127\" id=\"story-continues-3\">By law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days. The acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, an ally of Ms. Park\u2019s, will remain in office in the interim. The Trump administration is rushing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/asia/korea%2Dmissile%2Ddefense%2Dchina%2Dtrump.html?_r=0\">a missile defense system</a> to <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\" title=\"More news and information about South Korea.\" class=\"meta-loc\">South Korea</a> so that it can be in place before the election.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"2369\">The last time a South Korean leader was removed from office under popular pressure was in 1960, when the police fired on crowds calling for President Syngman Rhee to step down. (<a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/07/20/96708697.html?pageNumber=1\">Mr. Rhee, a dictator, fled into exile in Hawaii and died there</a>.)</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"2741\" id=\"story-continues-4\">In a sign of how far South Korea\u2019s young democracy has evolved, Ms. Park was removed without any violence, after large, peaceful protests in recent months demanding that she step down. In addition to the swell of popular anger, the legislature and the judiciary \u2014 two institutions that have been weaker than the presidency historically \u2014 were crucial to the outcome.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"185\" data-total-count=\"2926\">\u201cThis is a miracle, a new milestone in the strengthening and institutionalizing of democracy in South Korea,\u201d said Kang Won-taek, a political scientist at Seoul National University.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"287\" data-total-count=\"3213\" id=\"story-continues-5\">When crowds took to the streets, they were not just seeking to remove a leader who had one year left in office. They were also rebelling against a political order that had held South Korea together for decades but is now fracturing under pressures both at home and abroad, analysts said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"317\" data-total-count=\"3530\">Ms. Park\u2019s father ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979. He founded its economic growth model, which transformed the nation into an export powerhouse and allowed the emergence of family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol that benefited from tax cuts, anti-labor policies and other benefits from the government.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"151\" data-total-count=\"3681\" id=\"story-continues-6\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/world/asia/south-koreans-vote-in-closely-fought-presidential-race.html\">Ms. Park was elected in 2012</a> with the support of older conservative South Koreans who revered her father for the country\u2019s breakneck economic growth.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"139\" data-total-count=\"3820\">But the nexus of industry and political power gave rise to collusive ties, highlighted by the scandal that led to Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"147\" data-total-count=\"3967\" id=\"story-continues-7\">The scandal also swept up the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/business/jay-y-lee-samsung-trial.html\">de facto head of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong</a>, who was indicted on charges of bribing Ms. Park and her confidante, Ms. Choi.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"320\" data-total-count=\"4287\">Samsung, the nation\u2019s largest conglomerate, has been tainted by corruption before. But the company has been considered too important to the economy for any of its top leaders to spend time behind bars \u2014 until now. The jailing of Mr. Lee, who is facing trial, is another potent sign that the old order is not holding.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"353\" data-total-count=\"4640\">In the wake of the Park scandal, all political parties have vowed to curtail presidential power to pardon chaebol tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes. They also promised to stop chaebol chairmen from helping their children amass fortunes through dubious means, like forcing their companies to do exclusive business with the children\u2019s businesses.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"158\" data-total-count=\"4798\" id=\"story-continues-8\">With the conservatives discredited \u2014 and no leading conservative candidate to succeed Ms. Park \u2014 the left could take power for the first time in a decade.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"149\" data-total-count=\"4947\">The dominant campaign issues will probably be North Korea\u2019s <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/atomic_weapons/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about nuclear weapons.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">nuclear weapons</a> program and South Korea\u2019s relations with the United States and China.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"321\" data-total-count=\"5268\">If the opposition takes power, it may try to revive its old \u201csunshine policy\u201d of building ties with North Korea through aid and exchanges, an approach favored by China. That would complicate Washington\u2019s efforts to isolate the North at a time other Asian nations like the Philippines are gravitating toward Beijing.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"313\" data-total-count=\"5581\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-who-could-replace-park.html\">Moon Jae-in</a>, the Democratic Party leader who is leading in opinion surveys, has said that a decade of applying sanctions on North Korea has failed to stop its nuclear weapons programs. He has said that sanctions are necessary, but that \u201ctheir goal should be to draw North Korea back to the negotiating table.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"385\" data-total-count=\"5966\" id=\"story-continues-9\">He believes that Ms. Park\u2019s decision to allow the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/asia/north-korea-thaad-missile-defense-us-china.html\">deployment of the American missile defense system</a> \u2014 known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad \u2014 has dragged the country into the dangerous and growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing; China has called the system a threat to its own security and taken steps to punish South Korea economically for accepting it.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"436\" data-total-count=\"6402\">Conservative South Koreans see the deployment of the antimissile system not only as a guard against the North but also as a symbolic reaffirmation of the all-important alliance with the United States. Mr. Moon\u2019s party demands that the deployment, which began this week, be suspended immediately. If it takes power, it says it will review the deployment of the antimissile system to determine if it is in South Korea\u2019s best interest.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"205\" data-total-count=\"6607\">As South Korea has learned in painful fashion, it cannot always keep Washington and Beijing happy at the same time, as in the case of the country\u2019s decision to deploy the American missile defense system.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"280\" data-total-count=\"6887\" id=\"story-continues-10\">Yet Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment was also a pushback against \u201cCold War conservatives\u201d like her father, who seized on Communist threats from North Korea to silence political opponents and hide their corruption, said Kim Dong-choon, a sociologist at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"288\" data-total-count=\"7175\" id=\"story-continues-11\">Ms. Park\u2019s father tortured and even executed dissidents, framing them with spying charges. Now, his daughter faces charges that her government <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/world/asia/south%2Dkorea%2Dpresident%2Dpark%2Dblacklist%2Dartists.html\">blacklisted thousands of unfriendly artists and writers</a>, branding them pro-North Korean, and denied them access to government support programs.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"261\" data-total-count=\"7436\">\u201cHer removal means that the curtain is finally drawing on the authoritarian political and economic order that has dominated South Korea for decades,\u201d said Ahn Byong-jin, rector of the Global Academy for Future Civilizations at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"71\" data-total-count=\"7507\">Analysts cautioned that political and economic change will come slowly.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"220\" data-total-count=\"7727\">As Mr. Moon put it recently: \u201cWe need a national cleanup. We need to liquidate the old system and build a new South Korea. Only then can we complete the revolution started by the people who rallied with candlelight.\u201d</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 A court on Friday began a session that will decide the fate of impeached South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Eight judges from the Constitutional Court assembled to issue a verdict that will either remove Park from office over a corruption scandal or allow her to complete her term.   If Park is removed, it would mark the first time a South Korean president has been driven from office before the end of their term since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   In anticipation of the ruling, pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who want Park gone began showing up around the Constitutional Court building in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so that people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police also began preparing for the protests, putting on helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards.   South Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Park in December amid suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to filch from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.   For Park to be formally removed, at least six of the court's eight justices will have to support the impeachment motion filed by lawmakers, which accuses the president of extortion, bribery, abuse of power and leaking government secrets. Park has apologized for putting trust in her friend, Choi (pronounced CHWEY) Soon-sil, but denies any legal wrongdoing.   If the court unseats Park, the country's election law requires a presidential vote within 60 days, which likely means May 9.   The ruling would instantly strip Park of her powers and also her immunity against prosecution. She could be interrogated by prosecutors seeking to indict her on criminal charges. Park has repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors over the scandal in recent months, but that will be harder to do if prosecutors have an arrest warrant.   If a presidential election is triggered, opinion polls favor liberal opposition politician Moon Jae-in, who lost the 2012 race to Park.   Some experts worry that Park's reinstatement could trigger a violent reaction from the millions of protesters who have demonstrated in major cities nationwide over the past several months.   If Park returns to office, the country's next presidential election will be held on Dec. 20 as originally scheduled.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 After months of a political scandal that has crippled South Korea, President Park Geun-hye on Friday was stripped of her powers by the Constitutional Court.   Allegations that Park's long-time friend and daughter of a cult leader with no official role in the administration pulled government strings from the shadows has united many in a state of boiling rage. Other players who were caught in the widening scandal include Park's advisers and the Samsung heir. Here's a breakdown:   ___   TIES THAT BIND   At the center of the tempest is Choi Soon-sil, also known as Choi Seo-won, who is sometimes compared to Rasputin, the Russian mystic who gained power in the early 20th century through his influence over the tsar. Park and Choi met in the 1970s, around the time Park was acting as first lady. Her mother was killed during a 1974 assassination attempt on her father, military strongman Park Chung-hee. Choi's father, a shadowy figure named Choi Tae-min, was a Buddhist monk, a religious cult leader and a Christian pastor at different times. He emerged as the younger Park's mentor. Park became president of New Spirit, a patriotic group set up by Choi's father, and Choi Soon-sil was reportedly head of the group's college unit \u2014 the two women are seen talking at a New Spirit event in a 1979 government video. Rumors swirled that New Spirit allowed the Choi clan to build a fortune by using their connection to the Park family to collect bribes.   In 1990, Park resigned as chairman of a separate foundation over suspicions that she allowed the Choi family to manipulate it for personal gain. Choi Soon-sil, whose ex-husband is a former close aide of Park's, reportedly built a fortune during the 1980s and 1990s through real estate investments in affluent neighborhoods in southern Seoul.   ___   STACKS OF PRESIDENTIAL REPORTS   After weeks of speculation, Park acknowledged in 2016 that Choi had edited some presidential speeches and helped with \"public relations.\" A raft of media stories, however, portrays a much deeper involvement. The liberal Hankyoreh newspaper, for instance, citing a former Choi associate, reported that a senior presidential aide gave thick stacks of government draft reports to Choi on a daily basis. Choi then allegedly discussed the issues with her friends and sent back recommendations to the president. The newspaper reported that Choi made recommendations about the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, the jointly run Kaesong factory park in North Korea that was eventually shut down. Choi is also said to have used her relationship with Park to win special favors for Choi's daughter and to pressure businesses to contribute money to two nonprofit foundations that Choi helped create and that she then looted for her own use.   ___   SAMSUNG CONNECTION   According to prosecutors, Lee Jae-yong, the de-facto Samsung boss, used Samsung corporate funds to buy expensive horses for Choi's daughter. He also allegedly gave or promised 43.3 billion won ($38 million) to four entities controlled by Choi. Investigators say the money was given to obtain government backing for a contentious merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 that served as a key step in passing corporate control to Lee from his ailing father. Lee has denied the allegations, but was arrested last month on charges including bribery.   ___   LINKS TO A DICTATOR   The scandal struck a deep chord in a country that has only recently emerged into a vibrant, rich democracy after decades of colonization, war, poverty, dictatorship and deep-seated corruption. There is outrage that someone with Choi's colorful past might have not only exploited her ties to Park for massive financial gain and favor but also made important state decisions. Part of the anger is linked to the legacy of Park's dictator father. Revered by many for rebuilding from the rubble of war, critics say Park Chung-hee engineered his economic turnaround while committing massive human rights abuses and allowing widespread corruption by his friends.   ___   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Choi Soon-sil, whose ex-husband is a former close aide of Park's, reportedly built a fortune during the 1980s and 1990s through real estate investments in affluent neighborhoods in southern Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">STACKS OF PRESIDENTIAL REPORTS</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">After weeks of speculation, Park acknowledged in 2016 that Choi had edited some presidential speeches and helped with \"public relations.\" A raft of media stories, however, portrays a much deeper involvement. The liberal Hankyoreh newspaper, for instance, citing a former Choi associate, reported that a senior presidential aide gave thick stacks of government draft reports to Choi on a daily basis. Choi then allegedly discussed the issues with her friends and sent back recommendations to the president. The newspaper reported that Choi made recommendations about the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, the jointly run Kaesong factory park in North Korea that was eventually shut down. Choi is also said to have used her relationship with Park to win special favors for Choi's daughter and to pressure businesses to contribute money to two nonprofit foundations that Choi helped create and that she then looted for her own use.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">SAMSUNG CONNECTION</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">According to prosecutors, Lee Jae-yong, the de-facto Samsung boss, used Samsung corporate funds to buy expensive horses for Choi's daughter. He also allegedly gave or promised 43.3 billion won ($38 million) to four entities controlled by Choi. Investigators say the money was given to obtain government backing for a contentious merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 that served as a key step in passing corporate control to Lee from his ailing father. Lee has denied the allegations, but was arrested last month on charges including bribery.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">LINKS TO A DICTATOR</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The scandal struck a deep chord in a country that has only recently emerged into a vibrant, rich democracy after decades of colonization, war, poverty, dictatorship and deep-seated corruption. There is outrage that someone with Choi's colorful past might have not only exploited her ties to Park for massive financial gain and favor but also made important state decisions. Part of the anger is linked to the legacy of Park's dictator father. Revered by many for rebuilding from the rubble of war, critics say Park Chung-hee engineered his economic turnaround while committing massive human rights abuses and allowing widespread corruption by his friends.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 In a historic, unanimous ruling Friday, South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide.   Two people later died during protests against the court's decision, which capped a stunning fall for Park, the country's first female leader who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   The ruling by the eight-member panel opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from perennial rival North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' decades-long security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Lee accused Park of colluding with her longtime confidante and private citizen Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those are the allegations that prosecutors have already raised, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.   It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview with her.   Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn't planning any statement on Friday, it said.   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers with plastic flag poles and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.   An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.   Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee accused Park of colluding with her longtime confidante and private citizen Choi Soon-sil to extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses and letting Choi meddle in state affairs and receive and look at documents with state secrets. Those are the allegations that prosecutors have already raised, but Park has refused to undergo any questioning, citing a law that gives a sitting leader immunity from prosecution.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It is not clear when prosecutors will try to interview with her.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park won't vacate the presidential Blue House on Friday as her aides are preparing for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn't planning any statement on Friday, it said.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers with plastic flag poles and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">__</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 The Latest on South Korean President Park Geun-hye's removal from office Friday by the Constitutional Court (all times local):   3:45 p.m.   South Korea's presidential office says Park Geun-hye won't leave the presidential Blue House on Friday after the constitutional court stripped her of her presidential powers over a corruption scandal.   A Blue House spokesman said that some of Park's aides are at her southern Seoul home to prepare for her return, but it hasn't been determined exactly when she will leave the Blue House.   The spokesman says Park has no plans to issue a statement over the ruling on Friday.   3:20 p.m.   South Korea's acting head of state says he feels \"heavy responsibility\" after the Constitutional Court formally removed Park Geun-hye as president over a corruption scandal.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has been the government caretaker since lawmakers voted to impeach Park in December. He said Friday in a meeting with Cabinet ministers that the government needs to focus on maintaining defense and economic stability while preparing for a presidential by-election that must be held within 60 days.   Hwang also instructed the Justice Ministry and police to prepare for the possibility of violent protests following the ruling.   ___   2:40 p.m.   South Korean netizens are seeing a South Korean judge's hair rollers as a symbol of dedication and hard-working women on the day that the court that the judge leads dismissed the president from office.   Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi arrived at the Constitutional Court earlier Friday with two pink hair rollers attached to the back of her bobbed hair.   Pictures of her profile showing the round curlers as the justice walked to her office, apparently unaware, went viral.   Some South Koreans saw the apparent mistake as a sign of Lee's dedication to her work. Some linked it to President Park Geun-hye, who summoned her hair stylist to work hours after a deadly ferry sinking.   Lee, 65, is the sole female among eight judges on the Constitutional Court.   2:30 p.m.   South Korean police say a second person has died in protests against a court's decision to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   Police had no other details about the death Friday. Hospital official earlier said that another person, a man in his 70s, died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to oust Park.   The official said the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the office and died at around 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   2:25 p.m.   South Korea's defense minister has ordered the military to be on alert for possible North Korean provocations attempting to exploit \"unstable situations at home and abroad.\"   In a video conference on Friday with military commanders, Defense Minister Han Min Koo said North Korea can make \"strategic or operational\" provocations at any time. The North has test-fired ballistic missiles in recent weeks.   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has published a short dispatch on the court ruling in Seoul, anticipating that Park will now come under investigation as a \"regular criminal.\"   The party of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye, meanwhile, says it \"humbly accepts\" the ruling by the Constitutional Court to remove Park from office and that it feels responsible for her downfall.   ___   2:10 p.m.   A South Korean hospital official says that a man in his 70s died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   The official said Friday that the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the hospital and died at about 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters have angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles, and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   1:55 p.m.   Japan's top diplomat says it will continue to work with a South Korean government led by the successor of ousted President Park Geun-hye.   Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday that he would not comment on the court ruling that removed the impeached president, citing internal politics.   Kishida says both countries must work on the \"comfort women\" dispute that has strained their relations for decades. He says he hopes Tokyo and South Korea's new government can implement a 2015 agreement they signed to fully resolve the impasse over sexual exploitation of the women by Japan for its troops before and during World War II.   Kishida says Japan has no immediate plan to send back the ambassador it temporarily recalled to protest a \"comfort woman\" statue built outside of its consulate in the South Korean city of Busan.   ___   11:55 a.m.   The United States says the removal of South Korean President Park Geun-hye is a domestic issue that doesn't affect its strong alliance with the country.   The Constitutional Court formally removed the impeached Park from office Friday over a corruption scandal.   State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the U.S. will continue to work with the acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, and looks forward to whomever South Koreans choose in a presidential election to be held within two months.   Toner says Park's removal is \"a domestic issue on which the United States takes no position,\" and that it's up to the South Korean people to determine their country's future.   He says the two nations' alliance \"will continue to be a linchpin of regional stability and security.\"",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Sensing history, hundreds of people gathered Friday ahead of a court ruling on whether impeached South Korean President Park Geun-hye will be removed from office over a corruption scandal or allowed to complete her term.   If Park is removed, it would mark the first time a South Korean president has been driven from office before the end of their term since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   In anticipation of the ruling, pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who want Park gone began showing up around the Constitutional Court building in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so that people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police also began preparing for the protests, putting on helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards.   South Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Park in December amid suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to filch from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.   For Park to be formally removed, at least six of the court's eight justices will have to support the impeachment motion filed by lawmakers, which accuses the president of extortion, bribery, abuse of power and leaking government secrets. Park has apologized for putting trust in her friend, Choi (pronounced CHWEY) Soon-sil, but denies any legal wrongdoing.   If the court unseats Park, the country's election law requires a presidential vote within 60 days, which likely means May 9.   The ruling would instantly strip Park of her powers and also her immunity against prosecution. She could be interrogated by prosecutors seeking to indict her on criminal charges. Park has repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors over the scandal in recent months, but that will be harder to do if prosecutors have an arrest warrant.   If a presidential election is triggered, opinion polls favor liberal opposition politician Moon Jae-in, who lost the 2012 race to Park.   Some experts worry that Park's reinstatement could trigger a violent reaction from the millions of protesters who have demonstrated in major cities nationwide over the past several months.   If Park returns to office, the country's next presidential election will be held on Dec. 20 as originally scheduled.",

   "content": "SEOUL  South Korea's Constitutional Court will on Friday deliver a ruling on a parliamentary vote impeaching President Park Geun-hye which could oust her from office and see a snap election within 60 days. If the court upholds parliament's Dec. 9 vote to impeach Park over an influence-peddling scandal, she will be the country's first democratically elected leader to be forced from power, and an election would likely be called for May. The court will begin a hearing to deliver its ruling at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) The scandal has preoccupied the country for months, at a time when rival North Korea is pushing ahead with its missile program and tension is brewing with China over a U.S. missile-defense system being deployed in South Korea. \n Park, 65, has been accused of colluding with a friend, Choi Soon-sil, and a former presidential aide, both of whom have been on trial, to pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to back her policy initiatives. She is also accused of soliciting bribes from the head of the Samsung Group for government favors including the backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that was seen to support the succession of control over the country's largest \"chaebol\" conglomerate. \n Park has denied any wrongdoing. The scandal has led to weekly protests by tens of thousands of people, not only those who want Park to step down but also her supporters calling for her to stay on in power. \n \"A historic verdict on impeachment will be handed down,\"  Choo Mi-ae, head of the opposition Democratic Party, told a party meeting on Friday. \"I am confident the Constitutional Court will decide to uphold the impeachment following the public demand.\" After weeks of deliberations and hearings, members of the  eight-judge team arrived at the central Seoul court early on Friday. The did not speak to reporters. One of the judges was seen getting out of her car with curlers in her hair.  (Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Michael Perry)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The Latest on South Korean President Park Geun-hye's removal from office Friday by the Constitutional Court (all times local):   3:20 p.m.   South Korea's acting head of state says he feels \"heavy responsibility\" after the Constitutional Court formally removed Park Geun-hye as president over a corruption scandal.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has been the government caretaker since lawmakers voted to impeach Park in December. He said Friday in a meeting with Cabinet ministers that the government needs to focus on maintaining defense and economic stability while preparing for a presidential by-election that must be held within 60 days.   Hwang also instructed the Justice Ministry and police to prepare for the possibility of violent protests following the ruling.   ___   2:40 p.m.   South Korean netizens are seeing a South Korean judge's hair rollers as a symbol of dedication and hard-working women on the day that the court that the judge leads dismissed the president from office.   Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi arrived at the Constitutional Court earlier Friday with two pink hair rollers attached to the back of her bobbed hair.   Pictures of her profile showing the round curlers as the justice walked to her office, apparently unaware, went viral.   Some South Koreans saw the apparent mistake as a sign of Lee's dedication to her work. Some linked it to President Park Geun-hye, who summoned her hair stylist to work hours after a deadly ferry sinking.   Lee, 65, is the sole female among eight judges on the Constitutional Court.   2:30 p.m.   South Korean police say a second person has died in protests against a court's decision to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   Police had no other details about the death Friday. Hospital official earlier said that another person, a man in his 70s, died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to oust Park.   The official said the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the office and died at around 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   2:25 p.m.   South Korea's defense minister has ordered the military to be on alert for possible North Korean provocations attempting to exploit \"unstable situations at home and abroad.\"   In a video conference on Friday with military commanders, Defense Minister Han Min Koo said North Korea can make \"strategic or operational\" provocations at any time. The North has test-fired ballistic missiles in recent weeks.   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has published a short dispatch on the court ruling in Seoul, anticipating that Park will now come under investigation as a \"regular criminal.\"   The party of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye, meanwhile, says it \"humbly accepts\" the ruling by the Constitutional Court to remove Park from office and that it feels responsible for her downfall.   ___   2:10 p.m.   A South Korean hospital official says that a man in his 70s died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   The official said Friday that the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the hospital and died at about 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters have angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles, and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   1:55 p.m.   Japan's top diplomat says it will continue to work with a South Korean government led by the successor of ousted President Park Geun-hye.   Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday that he would not comment on the court ruling that removed the impeached president, citing internal politics.   Kishida says both countries must work on the \"comfort women\" dispute that has strained their relations for decades. He says he hopes Tokyo and South Korea's new government can implement a 2015 agreement they signed to fully resolve the impasse over sexual exploitation of the women by Japan for its troops before and during World War II.   Kishida says Japan has no immediate plan to send back the ambassador it temporarily recalled to protest a \"comfort woman\" statue built outside of its consulate in the South Korean city of Busan.   ___   11:55 a.m.   The United States says the removal of South Korean President Park Geun-hye is a domestic issue that doesn't affect its strong alliance with the country.   The Constitutional Court formally removed the impeached Park from office Friday over a corruption scandal.   State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the U.S. will continue to work with the acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, and looks forward to whomever South Koreans choose in a presidential election to be held within two months.   Toner says Park's removal is \"a domestic issue on which the United States takes no position,\" and that it's up to the South Korean people to determine their country's future.   He says the two nations' alliance \"will continue to be a linchpin of regional stability and security.\"",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 In a historic, unanimous ruling Friday, South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide.   Two people later died during protests against the court's decision, which capped a stunning fall for Park, the country's first female leader who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation's streets.   The ruling by the eight-member panel opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings \u2014 prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect \u2014 and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s.   It also deepens South Korea's political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from perennial rival North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul's cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration's commitment to the countries' decades-long security alliance.   Park's \"acts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \"The benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"   Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"   South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.   Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.   Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.   A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.   Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers with plastic flag poles and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.   The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.   An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.   Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.   People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.   \"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"   Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.   Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes.   Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.   Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won't be difficult.   Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.   Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy.   But her father was also a burden, as many here remember him as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father's high-handed style.   \"The nostalgia for Park Chung-hee's developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the '60s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye's impeachment,\" said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \"When people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn't do so because of her.\"   Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on what she called public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing.   The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \"when I had difficulties\" in the past. Park and Choi had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016, and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors.   Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader.   In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.   __   Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.",

Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park's impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \"tragic decision\" made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \"kangaroo court.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Sensing history, thousands of people \u2014 both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone \u2014 gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some of Park's supporters reacted with anger after the ruling, shouting and hitting police officers with plastic flag poles and climbing on police buses. Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said two people died while protesting Park's removal. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said that a man in his 70s, believed to be a Park supporter, died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn't immediately confirm the cause of death.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since she's now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won't be difficult.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China's retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn't sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">But her father was also a burden, as many here remember him as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father's high-handed style.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">\"The nostalgia for Park Chung-hee's developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the '60s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye's impeachment,\" said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \"When people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn't do so because of her.\"</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on what she called public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \"when I had difficulties\" in the past. Park and Choi had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016, and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park's impeachment, and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for president as a conservative candidate.

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The Latest on South Korean President Park Geun-hye's removal from office Friday by the Constitutional Court (all times local):   2:40 p.m.   South Korean netizens are seeing a South Korean judge's hair rollers as a symbol of dedication and hard-working women on the day that the court that the judge leads dismissed the president from office.   Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi arrived at the Constitutional Court earlier Friday with two pink hair rollers attached to the back of her bobbed hair.   Pictures of her profile showing the round curlers as the justice walked to her office, apparently unaware, went viral.   Some South Koreans saw the apparent mistake as a sign of Lee's dedication to her work. Some linked it to President Park Geun-hye, who summoned her hair stylist to work hours after a deadly ferry sinking.   Lee, 65, is the sole female among eight judges on the Constitutional Court.   2:30 p.m.   South Korean police say a second person has died in protests against a court's decision to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   Police had no other details about the death Friday. Hospital official earlier said that another person, a man in his 70s, died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to oust Park.   The official said the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the office and died at around 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   2:25 p.m.   South Korea's defense minister has ordered the military to be on alert for possible North Korean provocations attempting to exploit \"unstable situations at home and abroad.\"   In a video conference on Friday with military commanders, Defense Minister Han Min Koo said North Korea can make \"strategic or operational\" provocations at any time. The North has test-fired ballistic missiles in recent weeks.   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has published a short dispatch on the court ruling in Seoul, anticipating that Park will now come under investigation as a \"regular criminal.\"   The party of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye, meanwhile, says it \"humbly accepts\" the ruling by the Constitutional Court to remove Park from office and that it feels responsible for her downfall.   ___   2:10 p.m.   A South Korean hospital official says that a man in his 70s died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   The official said Friday that the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the hospital and died at about 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters have angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles, and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   1:55 p.m.   Japan's top diplomat says it will continue to work with a South Korean government led by the successor of ousted President Park Geun-hye.   Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday that he would not comment on the court ruling that removed the impeached president, citing internal politics.   Kishida says both countries must work on the \"comfort women\" dispute that has strained their relations for decades. He says he hopes Tokyo and South Korea's new government can implement a 2015 agreement they signed to fully resolve the impasse over sexual exploitation of the women by Japan for its troops before and during World War II.   Kishida says Japan has no immediate plan to send back the ambassador it temporarily recalled to protest a \"comfort woman\" statue built outside of its consulate in the South Korean city of Busan.   ___   11:55 a.m.   The United States says the removal of South Korean President Park Geun-hye is a domestic issue that doesn't affect its strong alliance with the country.   The Constitutional Court formally removed the impeached Park from office Friday over a corruption scandal.   State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the U.S. will continue to work with the acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, and looks forward to whomever South Koreans choose in a presidential election to be held within two months.   Toner says Park's removal is \"a domestic issue on which the United States takes no position,\" and that it's up to the South Korean people to determine their country's future.   He says the two nations' alliance \"will continue to be a linchpin of regional stability and security.\"",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The Latest on South Korean President Park Geun-hye's removal from office Friday by the Constitutional Court (all times local):   2:30 p.m.   South Korean police say a second person has died in protests against a court's decision to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   Police had no other details about the death Friday. Hospital official earlier said that another person, a man in his 70s, died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to oust Park.   The official said the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the office and died at around 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   2:25 p.m.   South Korea's defense minister has ordered the military to be on alert for possible North Korean provocations attempting to exploit \"unstable situations at home and abroad.\"   In a video conference on Friday with military commanders, Defense Minister Han Min Koo said North Korea can make \"strategic or operational\" provocations at any time. The North has test-fired ballistic missiles in recent weeks.   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has published a short dispatch on the court ruling in Seoul, anticipating that Park will now come under investigation as a \"regular criminal.\"   The party of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye, meanwhile, says it \"humbly accepts\" the ruling by the Constitutional Court to remove Park from office and that it feels responsible for her downfall.   ___   2:10 p.m.   A South Korean hospital official says that a man in his 70s died from head wounds after falling from a police bus in front of the Constitutional Court after it ruled to remove President Park Geun-hye from office.   The official said Friday that the man, believed to be a Park supporter, was bleeding heavily when he arrived at the hospital and died at about 1:50 p.m.   Thousands of Park's supporters have angrily reacted to the verdict, shouting and hitting police officers with flag poles, and climbing on buses the police used to create a perimeter protecting the court.   ___   1:55 p.m.   Japan's top diplomat says it will continue to work with a South Korean government led by the successor of ousted President Park Geun-hye.   Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday that he would not comment on the court ruling that removed the impeached president, citing internal politics.   Kishida says both countries must work on the \"comfort women\" dispute that has strained their relations for decades. He says he hopes Tokyo and South Korea's new government can implement a 2015 agreement they signed to fully resolve the impasse over sexual exploitation of the women by Japan for its troops before and during World War II.   Kishida says Japan has no immediate plan to send back the ambassador it temporarily recalled to protest a \"comfort woman\" statue built outside of its consulate in the South Korean city of Busan.   ___   11:55 a.m.   The United States says the removal of South Korean President Park Geun-hye is a domestic issue that doesn't affect its strong alliance with the country.   The Constitutional Court formally removed the impeached Park from office Friday over a corruption scandal.   State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the U.S. will continue to work with the acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, and looks forward to whomever South Koreans choose in a presidential election to be held within two months.   Toner says Park's removal is \"a domestic issue on which the United States takes no position,\" and that it's up to the South Korean people to determine their country's future.   He says the two nations' alliance \"will continue to be a linchpin of regional stability and security.\"",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Park Geun-hye finds out Friday whether a court will remove her from office over a corruption scandal or allow her to complete her term.   A look at the consequences of both possible decisions ahead of the Constitutional Court's ruling:   ___   IF PARK IS BOOTED   Following weeks of protests that saw millions take to the streets, South Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Park in December amid suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to filch from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.   For Park to be formally removed, at least six of the court's eight justices will have to support the impeachment motion filed by lawmakers, which accuses the president of extortion, bribery, abuse of power and leaking government secrets. Park has apologized for putting trust in her friend, Choi (pronounced CHWEY) Soon-sil, but denies any legal wrongdoing.   If the court unseats Park, the country's election law requires a presidential vote within 60 days, which likely means May 9.   The ruling would instantly strip Park of her powers and also her immunity against prosecution. She could be interrogated by prosecutors seeking to indict her on criminal charges. Park has repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors over the scandal in past months, but that will be harder to do if prosecutors have an arrest warrant.   If a presidential election is triggered, opinion polls favor liberal opposition politician Moon Jae-in, who lost the 2012 race to Park, to succeed her.   A Moon presidency could bring significant changes after a decade of conservative rule. He stresses the need for dialogue with belligerent, nuclear-armed North Korea, which would be a dramatic departure from Park's hard line.   Moon also vows to \"reconsider\" the South's plans to deploy this year an advanced U.S. anti-missile system; China says the system's powerful radar is a security threat.   ___   IF PARK IS REINSTATED   The court restoring Park's powers would be a huge victory for tens of thousands of her conservative supporters who rallied passionately near the court in recent weeks. It would also vindicate party loyalists who stuck with her even as dozens of their colleagues defected to create a new party in anticipation of an early presidential election. Such a decision will likely take the air out of the investigation into the scandal.   But some experts believe Park's reinstatement would only delay for a few months what seems to be an inevitable liberal presidential victory.   Park's single five-year term was originally due to end in February 2018, and regardless of the court's ruling, her credibility may be hopelessly compromised, the experts say. That's not ideal when she must navigate the country amid growing North Korean threats, a bad economy that could get worse with the diplomatic dispute with China, and a public sharply divided over the nation's future.   Some experts worry that Park's reinstatement could trigger a violent reaction from the millions of protesters who have been occupying the streets of major cities nationwide in the past several months.   The anti-Park rallies have been mostly peaceful, but some protesters said their \"candles will turn into torches\" if the court refuses to uphold Park's impeachment. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency on Thursday put its forces on high alert and deployed thousands of officers and hundreds of buses in the streets surrounding the court.   If Park returns to office, the country's next presidential election will be held on Dec. 20 as originally scheduled.",

   "content": "Five executives at Samsung, including the conglomerate\u2019s de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, formally denied bribery charges against them on Thursday, in a preliminary hearing for a trial with the potential to shake  South Korea .   Mr. Lee, who also goes by the name Jay Y. Lee, and the other executives face charges that strike at the heart of the deep ties between the South Korean government and powerful family-controlled businesses, a source of growing public resentment. Parliament voted in December to impeach  P resident   Park Geun-hye  over accusations of corruption and other abuses of power, and she could be  formally  removed from  office  soon.   But the related arrest of Mr. Lee, scion of the country\u2019s biggest and most profitable conglomerate, or chaebol, is a  momentous turn in itself . Chaebol bosses, including Mr. Lee\u2019s father, have been convicted in previous corruption cases, but punishments have usually been light or commuted.   Many see Mr. Lee\u2019s trial as a test of whether South Korea can change by abandoning longstanding deference to the business clans that have dominated the country\u2019s glittering economic rise. The chief prosecutor has said it could be the \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d   Mr. Lee is accused of funneling $36 million in bribes to a secretive confidante of Ms. Park\u2019s, as well as a range of other crimes: embezzlement, illegal transfer of property abroad and perjury before Parliament. He and the other executives, who are accused of aiding Mr. Lee, did not appear in court for the preliminary hearing on Thursday, but they denied the charges through lawyers.   Prosecutors say Mr. Lee sought a particularly South Korean favor in return: Approval for a merger that cemented his family\u2019s hold over the sprawling Samsung group, a vast and complex network of companies whose interests range from cellphones to shipbuilding.   The merger, of two Samsung affiliates, took place in 2015 and helped Mr. Lee, now 48, inherit corporate control from his father, Lee Kun-hee, who remains Samsung\u2019s chairman but has been out of the public eye since falling ill in 2014. The elder Mr. Lee has been convicted of corruption charges twice but was pardoned both times.   South Koreans are losing patience after years of chaebol-related corruption scandals. When crowds took to the streets in recent months to demand Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment, they also called for the arrest of Mr. Lee and other business leaders. That may have emboldened the special prosecutor,  Park Young-soo , who  had been struggling  to build criminal cases against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Prosecutors have named Ms. Park as an accomplice in Mr. Lee\u2019s case, most recently in a report issued on Monday about Mr. Lee\u2019s indictment.   Prosecutors say bribes Samsung made to members of Ms. Park\u2019s circle took many forms, including a $900,000 horse for the equestrian daughter of the president\u2019s confidante, Choi Soon-sil.   The preliminary hearing on Thursday attracted a modest crowd of onlookers, reporters and people with grievances against Samsung, a symbol both of national pride and, for many South Koreans, unfair elite privilege.   \u201cThere is a saying in Korean that goes, \u2018Guilty without money, and not guilty with money,\u2019 \u201d said Koh Hyun-sook, 53, who added that her husband was fighting a disability case against a Samsung company.   The hearing largely addressed the kind of evidence that would be allowed at the trial. Lawyers for Mr. Lee and other executives said prosecutors had overstepped the bounds of the case by contending that Samsung was engaged in a long-term, covert effort to ensure the Lee family succession.   It remains unclear when the main trial will begin. The judge scheduled the next preliminary hearing for March 23.",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"225\" data-total-count=\"225\">Five executives at Samsung, including the conglomerate\u2019s de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, formally denied bribery charges against them on Thursday, in a preliminary hearing for a trial with the potential to shake <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\" title=\"More news and information about South Korea.\" class=\"meta-loc\">South Korea</a>.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"419\" data-total-count=\"644\">Mr. Lee, who also goes by the name Jay Y. Lee, and the other executives face charges that strike at the heart of the deep ties between the South Korean government and powerful family-controlled businesses, a source of growing public resentment. Parliament voted in December to impeach <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">P</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">resident </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\"> Park Geun-hye</a> over accusations of corruption and other abuses of power, and she could be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/asia/south-korea-president-impeach-park-geun-hye.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPark%20Geun-hye&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection\">formally</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/asia/south-korea-president-impeach-park-geun-hye.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPark%20Geun-hye&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection\"> removed from</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/asia/south-korea-president-impeach-park-geun-hye.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPark%20Geun-hye&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection\"> office</a> soon.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"293\" data-total-count=\"937\">But the related arrest of Mr. Lee, scion of the country\u2019s biggest and most profitable conglomerate, or chaebol, is a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/business/south-korea-samsung-bribery-lee.html\">momentous turn in itself</a>. Chaebol bosses, including Mr. Lee\u2019s father, have been convicted in previous corruption cases, but punishments have usually been light or commuted.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"265\" data-total-count=\"1202\">Many see Mr. Lee\u2019s trial as a test of whether South Korea can change by abandoning longstanding deference to the business clans that have dominated the country\u2019s glittering economic rise. The chief prosecutor has said it could be the \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"387\" data-total-count=\"1589\">Mr. Lee is accused of funneling $36 million in bribes to a secretive confidante of Ms. Park\u2019s, as well as a range of other crimes: embezzlement, illegal transfer of property abroad and perjury before Parliament. He and the other executives, who are accused of aiding Mr. Lee, did not appear in court for the preliminary hearing on Thursday, but they denied the charges through lawyers.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"1849\" id=\"story-continues-1\">Prosecutors say Mr. Lee sought a particularly South Korean favor in return: Approval for a merger that cemented his family\u2019s hold over the sprawling Samsung group, a vast and complex network of companies whose interests range from cellphones to shipbuilding.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"330\" data-total-count=\"2179\">The merger, of two Samsung affiliates, took place in 2015 and helped Mr. Lee, now 48, inherit corporate control from his father, Lee Kun-hee, who remains Samsung\u2019s chairman but has been out of the public eye since falling ill in 2014. The elder Mr. Lee has been convicted of corruption charges twice but was pardoned both times.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"527\" data-total-count=\"2706\">South Koreans are losing patience after years of chaebol-related corruption scandals. When crowds took to the streets in recent months to demand Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment, they also called for the arrest of Mr. Lee and other business leaders. That may have emboldened the special prosecutor, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/asia/president-park-geun-hye-bribery-korea.html\">Park Young-soo</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/samsung-korea-president-impeachment.html\">had been struggling</a> to build criminal cases against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Prosecutors have named Ms. Park as an accomplice in Mr. Lee\u2019s case, most recently in a report issued on Monday about Mr. Lee\u2019s indictment.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"189\" data-total-count=\"2895\">Prosecutors say bribes Samsung made to members of Ms. Park\u2019s circle took many forms, including a $900,000 horse for the equestrian daughter of the president\u2019s confidante, Choi Soon-sil.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"213\" data-total-count=\"3108\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The preliminary hearing on Thursday attracted a modest crowd of onlookers, reporters and people with grievances against Samsung, a symbol both of national pride and, for many South Koreans, unfair elite privilege.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"209\" data-total-count=\"3317\">\u201cThere is a saying in Korean that goes, \u2018Guilty without money, and not guilty with money,\u2019 \u201d said Koh Hyun-sook, 53, who added that her husband was fighting a disability case against a Samsung company.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"289\" data-total-count=\"3606\">The hearing largely addressed the kind of evidence that would be allowed at the trial. Lawyers for Mr. Lee and other executives said prosecutors had overstepped the bounds of the case by contending that Samsung was engaged in a long-term, covert effort to ensure the Lee family succession.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"113\" data-total-count=\"3719\" id=\"story-continues-3\">It remains unclear when the main trial will begin. The judge scheduled the next preliminary hearing for March 23.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Park Geun-hye finds out Friday whether a court will remove her from office over a corruption scandal or allow her to complete her term.   A look at the consequences of both possible decisions ahead of the Constitutional Court's ruling:   ___   IF PARK IS BOOTED   Following weeks of protests that saw millions take to the streets, South Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Park in December amid suspicions that she colluded with a confidante to filch from companies and allowed the friend to secretly manipulate state affairs.   For Park to be formally removed, at least six of the court's eight justices will have to support the impeachment motion filed by lawmakers, which accuses the president of extortion, bribery, abuse of power and leaking government secrets. Park has apologized for putting trust in her friend, Choi (pronounced CHWEY) Soon-sil, but denies any legal wrongdoing.   If the court unseats Park, the country's election law requires a presidential vote within 60 days, which likely means May 9.   The ruling would instantly strip Park of her powers and also her immunity against prosecution. She could be interrogated by prosecutors seeking to indict her on criminal charges. Park has repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors over the scandal in past months, but that will be harder to do if prosecutors have an arrest warrant.   If a presidential election is triggered, opinion polls favor liberal opposition politician Moon Jae-in, who lost the 2012 race to Park, to succeed her.   A Moon presidency could bring significant changes after a decade of conservative rule. He stresses the need for dialogue with belligerent, nuclear-armed North Korea, which would be a dramatic departure from Park's hard line.   Moon also vows to \"reconsider\" the South's plans to deploy this year an advanced U.S. anti-missile system; China says the system's powerful radar is a security threat.   ___   IF PARK IS REINSTATED   The court restoring Park's powers would be a huge victory for tens of thousands of her conservative supporters who rallied passionately near the court in recent weeks. It would also vindicate party loyalists who stuck with her even as dozens of their colleagues defected to create a new party in anticipation of an early presidential election. Such a decision will likely take the air out of the investigation into the scandal.   But some experts believe Park's reinstatement would only delay for a few months what seems to be an inevitable liberal presidential victory.   Park's single five-year term was originally due to end in February 2018, and regardless of the court's ruling, her credibility may be hopelessly compromised, the experts say. That's not ideal when she must navigate the country amid growing North Korean threats, a bad economy that could get worse with the diplomatic dispute with China, and a public sharply divided over the nation's future.   Some experts worry that Park's reinstatement could trigger a violent reaction from the millions of protesters who have been occupying the streets of major cities nationwide in the past several months.   The anti-Park rallies have been mostly peaceful, but some protesters said their \"candles will turn into torches\" if the court refuses to uphold Park's impeachment. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency on Thursday put its forces on high alert and deployed thousands of officers and hundreds of buses in the streets surrounding the court.   If Park returns to office, the country's next presidential election will be held on Dec. 20 as originally scheduled.",

Park has apologized for putting trust in her friend, Choi (pronounced CHWEY) Soon-sil, but denies any legal wrongdoing.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">If the court unseats Park, the country's election law requires a presidential vote within 60 days, which likely means May 9.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The ruling would instantly strip Park of her powers and also her immunity against prosecution. She could be interrogated by prosecutors seeking to indict her on criminal charges. Park has repeatedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors over the scandal in past months, but that will be harder to do if prosecutors have an arrest warrant.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">If a presidential election is triggered, opinion polls favor liberal opposition politician Moon Jae-in, who lost the 2012 race to Park, to succeed her.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">A Moon presidency could bring significant changes after a decade of conservative rule. He stresses the need for dialogue with belligerent, nuclear-armed North Korea, which would be a dramatic departure from Park's hard line.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Moon also vows to \"reconsider\" the South's plans to deploy this year an advanced U.S. anti-missile system; China says the system's powerful radar is a security threat.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">___</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">IF PARK IS REINSTATED</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The court restoring Park's powers would be a huge victory for tens of thousands of her conservative supporters who rallied passionately near the court in recent weeks. It would also vindicate party loyalists who stuck with her even as dozens of their colleagues defected to create a new party in anticipation of an early presidential election. Such a decision will likely take the air out of the investigation into the scandal.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">But some experts believe Park's reinstatement would only delay for a few months what seems to be an inevitable liberal presidential victory.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Park's single five-year term was originally due to end in February 2018, and regardless of the court's ruling, her credibility may be hopelessly compromised, the experts say. That's not ideal when she must navigate the country amid growing North Korean threats, a bad economy that could get worse with the diplomatic dispute with China, and a public sharply divided over the nation's future.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Some experts worry that Park's reinstatement could trigger a violent reaction from the millions of protesters who have been occupying the streets of major cities nationwide in the past several months.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The anti-Park rallies have been mostly peaceful, but some protesters said their \"candles will turn into torches\" if the court refuses to uphold Park's impeachment. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency on Thursday put its forces on high alert and deployed thousands of officers and hundreds of buses in the streets surrounding the court.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">If Park returns to office, the country's next presidential election will be held on Dec. 20 as originally scheduled.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The Constitutional Court of  South Korea  said it would rule on Friday whether to reinstate President  Park Geun-hye  or formally oust her from office on charges of corruption and abuse of power.   Ms. Park has been suspended from office, with all her presidential powers frozen, since the National Assembly overwhelmingly  voted to impeach her  in December on charges of abusing power and collecting bribes from businesses.   If the Constitutional Court supports the vote in its verdict on Friday, Ms. Park will become the first South Korean president to lose office through parliamentary impeachment.   The court has held 17 hearings since the impeachment vote, but Ms. Park has never appeared in court. In a statement read by one of her lawyers during the last hearing, on Feb. 27, she vehemently denied any wrongdoing.   \u201cI feel crushed by all these misunderstandings and allegations,\u201d she said, calling the accusations groundless.   But Kweon Seong-dong, the lead prosecutor in the impeachment trial, called Ms. Park and her secretive confidante, Choi Soon-sil, \u201cenemies to democracy.\u201d   In the scandal, which has rocked South Korea for months, Ms. Park and Ms. Choi were accused of conspiring to collect tens of millions of dollars in bribes from businesses. Ms. Park was also accused of letting Ms. Choi, who had no experience in policy making, edit her speeches, install acquaintances as senior government officials and influence state affairs from the shadows.   In its impeachment motion, the legislature also accused Ms. Park of undermining freedom of the press by cracking down on her critics and of shirking her duty to protect citizens\u2019 lives by neglecting to respond efficiently to a  ferry disaster in 2014  that killed more than 300 people.   If at least six members of the nine-judge Constitutional Court vote to impeach, Ms. Park will be removed from office. South Korea will then have 60 days to elect a successor, with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn acting as president during that time.   If fewer than six judges vote for impeachment, Ms. Park will immediately be returned to office. Her five-year term ends next February.   The court has been working with only eight judges after one retired in January, but that will not affect the required number of votes for or against impeachment.   No South Korean president has been forced from office through impeachment. The National Assembly voted in 2004 to impeach President Roh Moo-hyun, but the Constitutional Court reinstated him, ruling that his violations of election law were too minor to justify ending his presidency. Mr. Roh did not attend the court\u2019s hearings on his impeachment.   The charges against Ms. Park are considered much more serious than those that Mr. Roh faced, and they have infuriated the public.  Large crowds have gathered  in central Seoul for months on Saturdays demanding an end to her presidency. In recent weeks, however, Ms. Park\u2019s supporters have also  organized big rallies  calling for her reinstatement.   Regardless of the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling, Ms. Park will most likely face criminal charges as soon as her presidency ends. While in office, she is protected from indictment.   On Monday, a special prosecutor  asked state prosecutors  to indict Ms. Park on bribery charges, saying that she and Ms. Choi conspired to take $38 million in bribes from Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Samsung\u2019s vice chairman, Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation scion of the family who runs the conglomerate, goes on trial this week  on bribery charges .   The special prosecutor said that the president should also face a criminal charge of abusing official power, saying she  conspired with aides  to blacklist thousands of artists, writers and movie directors deemed unfriendly to her government and exclude them from government-funded support programs.",

South Korea will then have 60 days to elect a successor, with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn acting as president during that time.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"134\" data-total-count=\"2141\">If fewer than six judges vote for impeachment, Ms. Park will immediately be returned to office. Her five-year term ends next February.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"161\" data-total-count=\"2302\">The court has been working with only eight judges after one retired in January, but that will not affect the required number of votes for or against impeachment.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"348\" data-total-count=\"2650\" id=\"story-continues-3\">No South Korean president has been forced from office through impeachment. The National Assembly voted in 2004 to impeach President Roh Moo-hyun, but the Constitutional Court reinstated him, ruling that his violations of election law were too minor to justify ending his presidency. Mr. Roh did not attend the court\u2019s hearings on his impeachment.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"346\" data-total-count=\"2996\">The charges against Ms. Park are considered much more serious than those that Mr. Roh faced, and they have infuriated the public. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html\">Large crowds have gathered</a> in central Seoul for months on Saturdays demanding an end to her presidency. In recent weeks, however, Ms. Park\u2019s supporters have also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/asia/south-korea-impeached-leader-park-geun-hye.html\">organized big rallies</a> calling for her reinstatement.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"181\" data-total-count=\"3177\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Regardless of the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling, Ms. Park will most likely face criminal charges as soon as her presidency ends. While in office, she is protected from indictment.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"381\" data-total-count=\"3558\">On Monday, a special prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/asia/president-park-geun-hye-bribery-korea.html\">asked state prosecutors</a> to indict Ms. Park on bribery charges, saying that she and Ms. Choi conspired to take $38 million in bribes from Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Samsung\u2019s vice chairman, Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation scion of the family who runs the conglomerate, goes on trial this week <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/world/asia/lee-jae-yong-samsung.html\">on bribery charges</a>.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"297\" data-total-count=\"3855\" id=\"story-continues-5\">The special prosecutor said that the president should also face a criminal charge of abusing official power, saying she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-blacklist-artists.html\">conspired with aides</a> to blacklist thousands of artists, writers and movie directors deemed unfriendly to her government and exclude them from government-funded support programs.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A special prosecutor in  South Korea  asked state prosecutors on Monday to indict President  Park Geun-hye  on bribery charges, saying that Ms. Park and her secretive confidante conspired to take $38 million in bribes from Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies.   The special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, recommended the indictment as he announced the results of his team\u2019s 90-day investigation into a corruption scandal surrounding Ms. Park, who was  impeached by a  p arliamentary vote  in December.   The inquiry resulted in the indictments of 30 people, including several former aides to Ms. Park, on criminal charges, including the abuse of official power. But the prosecutor could not bring any charge against Ms. Park because she is protected from indictment while in office.   His mandate now over, Mr. Park said he was leaving the task of indicting Ms. Park once she is out of office to state prosecutors.   Ms. Park\u2019s presidential powers have been suspended since the impeachment vote in December. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. Even if she resumes the presidency, her five-year term ends in February, after which she can face criminal charges.   On Monday, Ms. Park\u2019s lawyer, Yu Young-ha, rejected the special prosecutor\u2019s findings, saying his investigation was \u201cpolitically biased\u201d and \u201clacking in fairness.\u201d He called the bribery allegation \u201can absurd fiction.\u201d   But on Monday, Mr. Park, the special prosecutor, who is not related to Ms. Park, said his team found enough evidence that Ms. Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, conspired to collect bribes from Samsung.   On Feb. 28, he  indicted Lee Jae-yong , the third-generation scion of the family that runs Samsung, on charges of giving or promising $38 million in bribes to Ms. Park and Ms. Choi. He also added a bribery charge to the case against Ms. Choi, who is already on trial.   Mr. Lee offered the bribes in return for political favors from Ms. Park, most notably government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped him inherit corporate control of the Samsung conglomerate from his incapacitated father, Lee Kun-hee, the prosecutor said.   Acting on Ms. Park\u2019s order, her aides forced the government-controlled National Pension Service, a major shareholder at the two Samsung companies, to vote for the merger, though it was opposed by many minority shareholders and devalued the pension fund\u2019s own stocks there, the prosecutor said.   On Monday, Samsung denied the special prosecutor\u2019s findings.   \u201cSamsung has not paid bribes nor made improper requests seeking favors,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cFuture court proceedings will reveal the truth.\u201d   On Monday, Mr. Park, the special prosecutor, said that the president should also face a criminal charge of abusing official power, saying she conspired with aides  to blacklist thousands of artists, writers and movie directors  deemed unfriendly to her government and exclude them from government-funded support programs.   Ms. Park also fired three senior Culture Ministry officials who had been reluctant to discriminate against some of the 9,473 names on the list, the prosecutor said. She demoted and later fired another senior ministry official who had angered Ms. Choi, her friend, by  investigating allegations of corruption  involving her family, the prosecutor said.   While blackballing unfriendly artists, Ms. Park\u2019s office ensured that pro-government civic groups received special favors, he said.   It asked the Federation of Korean Industries, which lobbies on behalf of Samsung and other big businesses, to provide $5.9 million for those groups between 2014 and 2016, the special prosecutor said. Some of those groups, like the right-wing Korea Parent Federation, have held noisy protests in downtown Seoul calling the critics of Ms. Park \u201ccommies.\u201d   Besides Samsung, scores of other South Korean companies were found to have made payments to two foundations controlled by Ms. Choi. But on Monday, the special prosecutor did not recommend further actions against them, and state prosecutors had earlier said that those companies were coerced to donate and were not engaged in bribery.   Ms. Park has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing, insisting that she was framed by hostile political forces and that she was not aware of any criminal conspiracy by Ms. Choi. She said she only let Ms. Choi edit some of her speeches and run her personal errands.   On Monday, the special prosecutor said Ms. Park and Ms. Choi had 573 phone conversations between April and October last year using cellphones issued under borrowed names. Of these calls, 127 took place between September, when Ms. Choi left for Germany, and October, when she returned home to be arrested.   The prosecutor accused Ms. Park of impeding his investigation. She refused to be questioned by his investigators and also did not allow them to search her office. As a result, he said his team could not fully determine what she was doing at her residence for seven hours in April 2014, when a  ferry loaded with hundreds of schoolchildren sank , killing more than 300.   Ms. Park said she was working at the time, getting reports on the disaster. But she has been  haunted by lurid rumors , some of them claiming that she was having a romantic encounter or undergoing plastic surgery.   On Monday, the prosecutor said a cosmetic surgeon gave Ms. Park at least five simple face-lifting operations at her residence between 2013 and 2016. Even unlicensed people visited her there to give her nutritional shots and help her with kinesiotherapy and reiki, a form of traditional healing. But investigators could not find evidence that such things took place on the day of the ferry disaster.",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"301\" data-total-count=\"301\">SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A special prosecutor in <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\" title=\"More news and information about South Korea.\" class=\"meta-loc\">South Korea</a> asked state prosecutors on Monday to indict President <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/park_geunhye/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Park Geun-hye.\" class=\"meta-per\">Park Geun-hye</a> on bribery charges, saying that Ms. Park and her secretive confidante conspired to take $38 million in bribes from Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"535\">The special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, recommended the indictment as he announced the results of his team\u2019s 90-day investigation into a corruption scandal surrounding Ms. Park, who was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">impeached by a </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">p</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html\">arliamentary vote</a> in December.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"278\" data-total-count=\"813\">The inquiry resulted in the indictments of 30 people, including several former aides to Ms. Park, on criminal charges, including the abuse of official power. But the prosecutor could not bring any charge against Ms. Park because she is protected from indictment while in office.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"129\" data-total-count=\"942\">His mandate now over, Mr. Park said he was leaving the task of indicting Ms. Park once she is out of office to state prosecutors.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"342\" data-total-count=\"1284\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Ms. Park\u2019s presidential powers have been suspended since the impeachment vote in December. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. Even if she resumes the presidency, her five-year term ends in February, after which she can face criminal charges.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"233\" data-total-count=\"1517\" id=\"story-continues-3\">On Monday, Ms. Park\u2019s lawyer, Yu Young-ha, rejected the special prosecutor\u2019s findings, saying his investigation was \u201cpolitically biased\u201d and \u201clacking in fairness.\u201d He called the bribery allegation \u201can absurd fiction.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"207\" data-total-count=\"1724\">But on Monday, Mr. Park, the special prosecutor, who is not related to Ms. Park, said his team found enough evidence that Ms. Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, conspired to collect bribes from Samsung.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"265\" data-total-count=\"1989\">On Feb. 28, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/world/asia/lee-jae-yong-samsung.html\">indicted Lee Jae-yong</a>, the third-generation scion of the family that runs Samsung, on charges of giving or promising $38 million in bribes to Ms. Park and Ms. Choi. He also added a bribery charge to the case against Ms. Choi, who is already on trial.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"286\" data-total-count=\"2275\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Mr. Lee offered the bribes in return for political favors from Ms. Park, most notably government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped him inherit corporate control of the Samsung conglomerate from his incapacitated father, Lee Kun-hee, the prosecutor said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"297\" data-total-count=\"2572\">Acting on Ms. Park\u2019s order, her aides forced the government-controlled National Pension Service, a major shareholder at the two Samsung companies, to vote for the merger, though it was opposed by many minority shareholders and devalued the pension fund\u2019s own stocks there, the prosecutor said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"62\" data-total-count=\"2634\" id=\"story-continues-5\">On Monday, Samsung denied the special prosecutor\u2019s findings.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"154\" data-total-count=\"2788\">\u201cSamsung has not paid bribes nor made improper requests seeking favors,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cFuture court proceedings will reveal the truth.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"319\" data-total-count=\"3107\">On Monday, Mr. Park, the special prosecutor, said that the president should also face a criminal charge of abusing official power, saying she conspired with aides <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-blacklist-artists.html\">to blacklist thousands of artists, writers and movie directors</a> deemed unfriendly to her government and exclude them from government-funded support programs.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"349\" data-total-count=\"3456\">Ms. Park also fired three senior Culture Ministry officials who had been reluctant to discriminate against some of the 9,473 names on the list, the prosecutor said. She demoted and later fired another senior ministry official who had angered Ms. Choi, her friend, by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye.html\">investigating allegations of corruption</a> involving her family, the prosecutor said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"133\" data-total-count=\"3589\" id=\"story-continues-6\">While blackballing unfriendly artists, Ms. Park\u2019s office ensured that pro-government civic groups received special favors, he said.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"356\" data-total-count=\"3945\" id=\"story-continues-7\">It asked the Federation of Korean Industries, which lobbies on behalf of Samsung and other big businesses, to provide $5.9 million for those groups between 2014 and 2016, the special prosecutor said. Some of those groups, like the right-wing Korea Parent Federation, have held noisy protests in downtown Seoul calling the critics of Ms. Park \u201ccommies.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"333\" data-total-count=\"4278\" id=\"story-continues-8\">Besides Samsung, scores of other South Korean companies were found to have made payments to two foundations controlled by Ms. Choi. But on Monday, the special prosecutor did not recommend further actions against them, and state prosecutors had earlier said that those companies were coerced to donate and were not engaged in bribery.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"4542\">Ms. Park has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing, insisting that she was framed by hostile political forces and that she was not aware of any criminal conspiracy by Ms. Choi. She said she only let Ms. Choi edit some of her speeches and run her personal errands.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"304\" data-total-count=\"4846\" id=\"story-continues-9\">On Monday, the special prosecutor said Ms. Park and Ms. Choi had 573 phone conversations between April and October last year using cellphones issued under borrowed names. Of these calls, 127 took place between September, when Ms. Choi left for Germany, and October, when she returned home to be arrested.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"366\" data-total-count=\"5212\">The prosecutor accused Ms. Park of impeding his investigation. She refused to be questioned by his investigators and also did not allow them to search her office. As a result, he said his team could not fully determine what she was doing at her residence for seven hours in April 2014, when a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/world/asia/south-korean-ferry-accident.html\">ferry loaded with hundreds of schoolchildren sank</a>, killing more than 300.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"211\" data-total-count=\"5423\">Ms. Park said she was working at the time, getting reports on the disaster. But she has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-defamation-verdict.html\">haunted by lurid rumors</a>, some of them claiming that she was having a romantic encounter or undergoing plastic surgery.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"398\" data-total-count=\"5821\">On Monday, the prosecutor said a cosmetic surgeon gave Ms. Park at least five simple face-lifting operations at her residence between 2013 and 2016. Even unlicensed people visited her there to give her nutritional shots and help her with kinesiotherapy and reiki, a form of traditional healing. But investigators could not find evidence that such things took place on the day of the ferry disaster.</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Jay Y. Lee, heir to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate empires, followed in the footsteps of his prominent father. He took charge of key businesses. He hobnobbed with his country\u2019s president. He brought in new ideas.   Then,  like his father , he was  charged  with breaking the law.   Mr. Lee, the de facto leader of  South Korea \u2019s  Samsung Group , was indicted on a charge of bribery this past week, accused of taking part in a political scandal that has rocked his home country. The image of a pillar of industry,  in handcuffs , escorted by the police from jail to meet with prosecutors sent a message that shocked even a jaded public: South Korea\u2019s postwar economic order is under threat.   Samsung has experienced this before. Since the 1960s, when the company was caught smuggling artificial sweetener, its leaders have been in and out of trouble with minor consequences.  Twice , Mr. Lee\u2019s father was  saved from prison  by a South Korean president worried that anything that hurt Samsung could also hurt an economic machine that lifted millions of people from the ashes of war.   The thought of Mr. Lee in jail has raised a tantalizing prospect for many South Koreans: This time could be different.   South Korea\u2019s political turmoil could usher in a new group of leaders less inclined to treat its business titans with kid gloves. The public is  increasingly fed up  with white-collar crime. Further, South Korea\u2019s unique blend of business, politics and top-down hierarchical management is looking increasingly untenable in a modern age of innovation, public dissatisfaction with the old order and cutthroat competition from China and the rest of the world.   Mr. Lee and key aides are accused of using bribes to cement the family\u2019s control of the Samsung empire \u2014 an accusation that, if proven, would add to growing public perception that the country\u2019s business elite are in it only for themselves. The ensuing scandal threatens to topple South Korea\u2019s government and lead to tougher moves against big business here.   Prosecutors also indicted a group of executives tasked with cementing Mr. Lee\u2019s grip over the sprawling empire \u2014 a group that critics say epitomizes where the country\u2019s business culture went wrong.   South Koreans are now coming to grips with a tale of corporate power and family intrigue. It includes a mysteriously ill patriarch, a  Rasputin-like  confidante of the country\u2019s president, a shadowy Samsung office that has disappeared and reappeared before, and an alleged bribe in the form of a horse.   But it also includes the growing realization that, to compete, Samsung and South Korea as a whole will have to take a hard look at the way they do business.   \u201cWe should not miss this opportunity to cut the corrupt ties between politics and businesses,\u201d said  Moon Jae-in , a lawmaker and opposition leader who is the favorite to become South Korea\u2019s next president. \u201cOnly when Samsung repents its collusion with politics and its anti-market activities, like seeking political favors, can it become stronger.\u201d   Like its home country, Samsung is a giant in transition. The conglomerate is one of the world\u2019s top sellers of televisions and smartphones, a key supplier for the innards of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the maker of products as varied as cargo ships and credit cards. Its many companies posted estimated combined sales of $262 billion. By itself, it accounts for one-fifth of its home country\u2019s exports.   All of that is under pressure. The infamous  failure  of its  fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone  tarnished its name. Chinese  rivals  are making cheaper \u2014 and increasingly sophisticated \u2014 phones, televisions and appliances. Its shipbuilding business is  shedding jobs . China\u2019s government is investing lavishly to build out rival makers of microchips and memory. The scandal will delay long-term efforts to address these problems.   Mr. Lee still may emerge unscathed. He argues that he didn\u2019t commit bribery and that, instead, he is the victim of extortion. Samsung said in a statement that it neither paid bribes nor sought favors, and said the truth would come to light in court.   But Mr. Lee\u2019s troubles \u2014 he was arrested, unprecedented for the leader of South Korea\u2019s largest company, before he was indicted \u2014 were a jolt to those who assumed Samsung could once again turn to its political ties for help.   Samsung, which means \u201cthree stars\u201d in Korean, has long prospered from politics. Founded by a grandfather of Mr. Lee as a small fish and produce trader in 1938, it branched out into new businesses after the Korean War, including textiles, sugar and alcohol \u2014 and later, in 1969, electronics.   The expansion was, in many respects, funded by the government. Its military dictator,  Park Chung-hee , wanted to transform South Korea into a country that made what it needed and exported the rest. At the same time, Mr. Park and his successors faced pressure from the country\u2019s struggling populace to get tough on businesses that were seen as profiting from the government\u2019s efforts to kick-start the economy.   The two sides struck a compromise. Mr. Park allowed Mr. Lee\u2019s grandfather and other business leaders to keep their wealth. In return, he urged them to invest in the country\u2019s economic development and to back his push to make South Korea an export powerhouse. To help, he plied them with cheap bank loans, beneficial \u201cbuy Korea\u201d policies and other inducements.   This business-government partnership helped wealthy business leaders and their families squeeze out smaller businesses and international competitors. Those groups came to be known as  chaebol , or \u201crich clan\u201d in Korean, and they dominate South Korea\u2019s economic life to this day. The nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol generate combined annual revenue equivalent to 80 percent of South Korea\u2019s total economic output, according to analyst estimates.   \u201cTo South Koreans, chaebol have two faces,\u201d said Kim Sang-jo, an economist at Hansung University in Seoul and an authority on Samsung. \u201cOn one hand, chaebol symbolize corrupt ties between business and politics, so people call for reforming chaebol. On the other hand, the economy is so heavily dependent on chaebol that people fear that shaking them too much might make them collapse.\u201d   \u201cSouth Korean people,\u201d he added, \u201chave never had a chance to learn how a modern globalized company should be run.\u201d   Jay Y. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, became Samsung\u2019s chairman after his father, Lee Byung-chull,  died in 1987 . He faced an immediate challenge: South Korea\u2019s economy had become one of the most successful in Asia, but abroad its products were seen as cheap and unreliable.   In a move that is now part of Samsung\u2019s internal lore, Lee Kun-hee told his (mostly male) executives to \u201cchange everything except your wife and kids\u201d and worked to improve Samsung\u2019s quality. He brought in foreign experts. When one batch of phones turned out to be defective, in 1995, he gathered thousands of them into a pile at one of Samsung\u2019s factories and set them on fire. The effort worked. Today Samsung is one of a very few electronics makers to command premium prices for its high-end televisions, smartphones and kitchen appliances.   But Samsung also found itself repeatedly entangled in some of South Korea\u2019s biggest corruption scandals. Lee Kun-hee was twice convicted, first of bribery and then of tax evasion. Each time, he received a suspended prison term and was later pardoned by the president.   In 2014, Lee Kun-hee  had a heart attack  and disappeared from public view. Samsung has said he is incapacitated, but it hasn\u2019t released details. Still, thanks to a powerful group of executives and advisers, the Lee family\u2019s grip on Samsung remained unchallenged.   When Lee Kun-hee\u2019s son, Jay Y. Lee, now 48, took effective reins of the family empire, he didn\u2019t do it alone.   The Lee family\u2019s ownership in the various Samsung companies isn\u2019t clear because many are not publicly traded, but it is widely believed to hold only small minority stakes. Instead, it controls the companies through loyal executives, as well as through interlocking contracts and shareholdings between the companies and other shadowy links.   At Samsung, some of the most loyal executives staffed the corporate strategy office. The office linked Samsung\u2019s chairman with a host of professional executives who run dozens of individual Samsung subsidiaries, which together now employ a half-million people globally. But the office had a less publicized role: It worked to enable the Lee family to pull off the dynastic transfer of control over Samsung\u2019s management.   Mr. Lee, polite and casual where his father could be remote and distant, by title a Samsung vice chairman, had the appearance of a with-it executive who wanted to bring Samsung into the modern era. Though Samsung\u2019s electronics arm made cutting-edge hardware, it was largely missing out on the boom in mobile apps and online services. He also believed that Samsung\u2019s strict corporate culture was holding back innovation.   In a few ways, under Mr. Lee, Samsung began to loosen up. He began a campaign to discourage managers from using harsh language with underlings, a common occurrence in South Korean offices. He also pledged to cut meetings and office hours, encouraged workers to challenge their bosses, and barred employees from using hierarchical titles in addressing one another \u2014 a norm in the South Korean corporate world. The initiative, heavily touted by the company, was called Start-Up Samsung.   But critics still saw a top-down approach. For example, the company announced Start-Up Samsung with a coordinated pledge from top executives.   Some current and former employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, said pressure from the top has only grown worse under Mr. Lee. Samsung\u2019s phone business \u2014 which was losing market share  in China and elsewhere  to cheap and increasingly sophisticated Chinese products made by Huawei and OnePlus \u2014 had made gains against Apple at the top end of the smartphone market. Hoping to capitalize, Samsung executives rushed to get its most powerful phone yet, the Galaxy Note 7, on the market before Apple introduced its new iPhone 7.   The result was disaster. First, a few Note 7 phones  caught fire . Then, after  an embarrassing and costly recall , some  new versions caught on fire  too. In an unusual move in the gadget business, Samsung pulled the phone from the market and canceled it. Kim Sang-jo, the Hansung University economist, and other outside experts blamed Mr. Lee and the corporate strategy office for the Note 7 debacle, saying they pushed big goals without listening to lower-level managers.   At the same time, the corporate strategy office was coming under fire for another move, a deal that would strengthen the family\u2019s hold on Samsung \u2014 but one that would also engulf it in scandal.   Under that office, Samsung pushed a merger of two of its units, Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T. Many outside shareholders  opposed the move , which would cement Mr. Lee\u2019s control over the whole conglomerate.   The trick was getting government approval \u2014 and to win it, prosecutors say, Mr. Lee and the corporate strategy office broke the law.   According to prosecutors, Mr. Lee met with South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, three times in an effort to cement the deal and smooth Mr. Lee\u2019s rise to power. In return, they say, Ms. Park, who has been impeached, asked Mr. Lee to support two foundations controlled by her secret confidante, a woman named  Choi Soon-sil . According to prosecutors, Mr. Lee and members of Samsung\u2019s corporate strategy office gave foundations and businesses linked to Ms. Choi $38 million. Samsung\u2019s contributions to Ms. Choi included an  $900,000 horse  for her  equestrian daughter .   The country\u2019s national pension fund, a major shareholder of the two Samsung companies,  approved the deal . According to prosecutors, the completed merger increased the stock value of the Lee family by at least $758 million. The country\u2019s national pension fund lost at least $123 million on the deal.   In a statement, Samsung said shareholders of both companies approved the deal before any donations were made. But it also said it introduced measures to manage donations, including greater public disclosure and more reviews by executives and directors.   Ms. Choi\u2019s relationship with Ms. Park last year ignited a nationwide scandal. Ms. Choi, who has no formal government title, was reported to have been involved with writing Ms. Park\u2019s speeches, choosing top government officials and even selecting her outfits. As the scandal spread, the alleged bribes came to the attention of prosecutors.   For many South Koreans, the scandal resonates. Ms. Park, who could soon be  removed from office , is the daughter of the dictator who gave Mr. Lee\u2019s family the support to broaden Samsung into the giant it is today. It also underscores the perception that today\u2019s chaebol leaders are hurting more than they are helping the country.   Others have said that the company culture has grown more strict since Mr. Lee\u2019s father was incapacitated and pressures on the company to perform well under Mr. Lee grew.   \u201cThey forgot their fathers\u2019 and grandfathers\u2019 entrepreneurship,\u201d said Mr. Moon, the opposition leader, referring to Mr. Lee and other third-generation chaebol leaders, \u201cand chose to make easy money.\u201d   Stung by the scandal, Samsung closed the corporate strategy office. Skeptics point out that Samsung has done that before. Mr. Lee\u2019s father disbanded the office when he ran into legal trouble, only to re-establish it under its current name once those troubles blew over. Its functions may simply migrate to another part of the empire, they say.   \u201cThe mission right now is to save Jay Y. Lee,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Saving Private Ryan.\u2019\u201d   Samsung said in a statement that its companies would be managed independently by its chief executives and directors.   But there is reason to believe this time could be different.   Already Mr. Lee has been punished more than his father, who never spent any time in jail. The case also implicates South Korea\u2019s president, while approval ratings for her pro-business party have plummeted, meaning political protection from the top is less likely. And public anger about collusion between companies and the government has never been greater, with protests breaking out this year.   It isn\u2019t clear whether somebody else may emerge to lead Samsung. Lee Boo-jin, Mr. Lee\u2019s sister and the country\u2019s richest woman, runs the Samsung affiliate Hotel Shilla, which also operates duty-free shops. With her brother in jail, some analysts speculated that she might try to increase her profile within the vast corporate empire. But most analysts say Samsung\u2019s complicated hierarchy is already dominated by executives loyal to Mr. Lee.   While analysts warn it isn\u2019t likely anything will immediately change, Samsung is undoubtedly facing a new level of pressure and scrutiny.   \u201cThe thing about Samsung is, it\u2019s a giant wound-up ball of yarn of cross-holdings,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book on Samsung. \u201cThe setup is so complicated that sometimes I wonder if a group of smart people could find a way to tug at the right connection and find a way to loosen it up, to unravel it a bit, just to see if they could pull it away from the company.\u201d   He added, \u201cThat\u2019s never happened in Korea before.\u201d",

   "raw_content": "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"245\" data-total-count=\"245\">SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Jay Y. Lee, heir to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate empires, followed in the footsteps of his prominent father. He took charge of key businesses. He hobnobbed with his country\u2019s president. He brought in new ideas.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"60\" data-total-count=\"305\">Then, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/business/worldbusiness/17iht-samsung.4.12107507.html\">like his father</a>, he was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/world/asia/lee-jae-yong-samsung.html\">charged</a> with breaking the law.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"406\" data-total-count=\"711\">Mr. Lee, the de facto leader of <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\" title=\"More news and information about South Korea.\" class=\"meta-loc\">South Korea</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/samsung_group/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about the Samsung Group.\" class=\"meta-org\">Samsung Group</a>, was indicted on a charge of bribery this past week, accused of taking part in a political scandal that has rocked his home country. The image of a pillar of industry, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/arrested-samsung-heir-appears-handcuffed-questioning-083230348.html\">in handcuffs</a>, escorted by the police from jail to meet with prosecutors sent a message that shocked even a jaded public: South Korea\u2019s postwar economic order is under threat.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"388\" data-total-count=\"1099\">Samsung has experienced this before. Since the 1960s, when the company was caught smuggling artificial sweetener, its leaders have been in and out of trouble with minor consequences. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/27/world/death-sentence-for-ex-president-chun-a-landmark-for-korea.html\">Twice</a>, Mr. Lee\u2019s father was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/business/global/30samsung.html\">saved from prison</a> by a South Korean president worried that anything that hurt Samsung could also hurt an economic machine that lifted millions of people from the ashes of war.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"118\" data-total-count=\"1217\">The thought of Mr. Lee in jail has raised a tantalizing prospect for many South Koreans: This time could be different.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"458\" data-total-count=\"1675\" id=\"story-continues-2\">South Korea\u2019s political turmoil could usher in a new group of leaders less inclined to treat its business titans with kid gloves. The public is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/business/dealbook/south-korea-targets-executives-pressed-by-an-angry-public.html\">increasingly fed up</a> with white-collar crime. Further, South Korea\u2019s unique blend of business, politics and top-down hierarchical management is looking increasingly untenable in a modern age of innovation, public dissatisfaction with the old order and cutthroat competition from China and the rest of the world.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"365\" data-total-count=\"2040\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Mr. Lee and key aides are accused of using bribes to cement the family\u2019s control of the Samsung empire \u2014 an accusation that, if proven, would add to growing public perception that the country\u2019s business elite are in it only for themselves. The ensuing scandal threatens to topple South Korea\u2019s government and lead to tougher moves against big business here.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"203\" data-total-count=\"2243\">Prosecutors also indicted a group of executives tasked with cementing Mr. Lee\u2019s grip over the sprawling empire \u2014 a group that critics say epitomizes where the country\u2019s business culture went wrong.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"302\" data-total-count=\"2545\">South Koreans are now coming to grips with a tale of corporate power and family intrigue. It includes a mysteriously ill patriarch, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/world/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-choi-soon-sil.html\">Rasputin-like</a> confidante of the country\u2019s president, a shadowy Samsung office that has disappeared and reappeared before, and an alleged bribe in the form of a horse.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"156\" data-total-count=\"2701\" id=\"story-continues-4\">But it also includes the growing realization that, to compete, Samsung and South Korea as a whole will have to take a hard look at the way they do business.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"358\" data-total-count=\"3059\">\u201cWe should not miss this opportunity to cut the corrupt ties between politics and businesses,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-who-could-replace-park.html\">Moon Jae-in</a>, a lawmaker and opposition leader who is the favorite to become South Korea\u2019s next president. \u201cOnly when Samsung repents its collusion with politics and its anti-market activities, like seeking political favors, can it become stronger.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"401\" data-total-count=\"3477\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Like its home country, Samsung is a giant in transition. The conglomerate is one of the world\u2019s top sellers of televisions and smartphones, a key supplier for the innards of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the maker of products as varied as cargo ships and credit cards. Its many companies posted estimated combined sales of $262 billion. By itself, it accounts for one-fifth of its home country\u2019s exports.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"430\" data-total-count=\"3907\">All of that is under pressure. The infamous <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/international/samsung-galaxy-note7-terminated.html\">failure</a> of its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/business/samsung-galaxy-note7-fires.html\">fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone</a> tarnished its name. Chinese <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/business/samsung-galaxy-note7-china-test.html\">rivals</a> are making cheaper \u2014 and increasingly sophisticated \u2014 phones, televisions and appliances. Its shipbuilding business is <a href=\"http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/01/12/0200000000AEN20170112002500320.html\">shedding jobs</a>. China\u2019s government is investing lavishly to build out rival makers of microchips and memory. The scandal will delay long-term efforts to address these problems.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"251\" data-total-count=\"4158\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Mr. Lee still may emerge unscathed. He argues that he didn\u2019t commit bribery and that, instead, he is the victim of extortion. Samsung said in a statement that it neither paid bribes nor sought favors, and said the truth would come to light in court.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"232\" data-total-count=\"4390\" id=\"story-continues-7\">But Mr. Lee\u2019s troubles \u2014 he was arrested, unprecedented for the leader of South Korea\u2019s largest company, before he was indicted \u2014 were a jolt to those who assumed Samsung could once again turn to its political ties for help.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"296\" data-total-count=\"4686\" id=\"story-continues-8\">Samsung, which means \u201cthree stars\u201d in Korean, has long prospered from politics. Founded by a grandfather of Mr. Lee as a small fish and produce trader in 1938, it branched out into new businesses after the Korean War, including textiles, sugar and alcohol \u2014 and later, in 1969, electronics.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"412\" data-total-count=\"5098\">The expansion was, in many respects, funded by the government. Its military dictator, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/24/world/ruthless-ex-dictator-getting-credit-for-south-korea-s-rise.html\">Park Chung-hee</a>, wanted to transform South Korea into a country that made what it needed and exported the rest. At the same time, Mr. Park and his successors faced pressure from the country\u2019s struggling populace to get tough on businesses that were seen as profiting from the government\u2019s efforts to kick-start the economy.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"367\" data-total-count=\"5465\" id=\"story-continues-9\">The two sides struck a compromise. Mr. Park allowed Mr. Lee\u2019s grandfather and other business leaders to keep their wealth. In return, he urged them to invest in the country\u2019s economic development and to back his push to make South Korea an export powerhouse. To help, he plied them with cheap bank loans, beneficial \u201cbuy Korea\u201d policies and other inducements.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"444\" data-total-count=\"5909\">This business-government partnership helped wealthy business leaders and their families squeeze out smaller businesses and international competitors. Those groups came to be known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/south-korea-chaebol-samsung.html\">chaebol</a>, or \u201crich clan\u201d in Korean, and they dominate South Korea\u2019s economic life to this day. The nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol generate combined annual revenue equivalent to 80 percent of South Korea\u2019s total economic output, according to analyst estimates.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"393\" data-total-count=\"6302\">\u201cTo South Koreans, chaebol have two faces,\u201d said Kim Sang-jo, an economist at Hansung University in Seoul and an authority on Samsung. \u201cOn one hand, chaebol symbolize corrupt ties between business and politics, so people call for reforming chaebol. On the other hand, the economy is so heavily dependent on chaebol that people fear that shaking them too much might make them collapse.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"122\" data-total-count=\"6424\">\u201cSouth Korean people,\u201d he added, \u201chave never had a chance to learn how a modern globalized company should be run.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"275\" data-total-count=\"6699\" id=\"story-continues-10\">Jay Y. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, became Samsung\u2019s chairman after his father, Lee Byung-chull, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/20/obituaries/lee-byung-chull-77-industrialist-of-korea.html\">died in 1987</a>. He faced an immediate challenge: South Korea\u2019s economy had become one of the most successful in Asia, but abroad its products were seen as cheap and unreliable.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"552\" data-total-count=\"7251\" id=\"story-continues-11\">In a move that is now part of Samsung\u2019s internal lore, Lee Kun-hee told his (mostly male) executives to \u201cchange everything except your wife and kids\u201d and worked to improve Samsung\u2019s quality. He brought in foreign experts. When one batch of phones turned out to be defective, in 1995, he gathered thousands of them into a pile at one of Samsung\u2019s factories and set them on fire. The effort worked. Today Samsung is one of a very few electronics makers to command premium prices for its high-end televisions, smartphones and kitchen appliances.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"269\" data-total-count=\"7520\" id=\"story-continues-12\">But Samsung also found itself repeatedly entangled in some of South Korea\u2019s biggest corruption scandals. Lee Kun-hee was twice convicted, first of bribery and then of tax evasion. Each time, he received a suspended prison term and was later pardoned by the president.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"265\" data-total-count=\"7785\">In 2014, Lee Kun-hee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/business/international/samsungs-chairman-has-surgery-after-heart-attack.html\">had a heart attack</a> and disappeared from public view. Samsung has said he is incapacitated, but it hasn\u2019t released details. Still, thanks to a powerful group of executives and advisers, the Lee family\u2019s grip on Samsung remained unchallenged.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"113\" data-total-count=\"7914\" id=\"story-continues-13\">When Lee Kun-hee\u2019s son, Jay Y. Lee, now 48, took effective reins of the family empire, he didn\u2019t do it alone.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"343\" data-total-count=\"8257\">The Lee family\u2019s ownership in the various Samsung companies isn\u2019t clear because many are not publicly traded, but it is widely believed to hold only small minority stakes. Instead, it controls the companies through loyal executives, as well as through interlocking contracts and shareholdings between the companies and other shadowy links.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"423\" data-total-count=\"8680\">At Samsung, some of the most loyal executives staffed the corporate strategy office. The office linked Samsung\u2019s chairman with a host of professional executives who run dozens of individual Samsung subsidiaries, which together now employ a half-million people globally. But the office had a less publicized role: It worked to enable the Lee family to pull off the dynastic transfer of control over Samsung\u2019s management.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"423\" data-total-count=\"9103\">Mr. Lee, polite and casual where his father could be remote and distant, by title a Samsung vice chairman, had the appearance of a with-it executive who wanted to bring Samsung into the modern era. Though Samsung\u2019s electronics arm made cutting-edge hardware, it was largely missing out on the boom in mobile apps and online services. He also believed that Samsung\u2019s strict corporate culture was holding back innovation.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"486\" data-total-count=\"9589\">In a few ways, under Mr. Lee, Samsung began to loosen up. He began a campaign to discourage managers from using harsh language with underlings, a common occurrence in South Korean offices. He also pledged to cut meetings and office hours, encouraged workers to challenge their bosses, and barred employees from using hierarchical titles in addressing one another \u2014 a norm in the South Korean corporate world. The initiative, heavily touted by the company, was called Start-Up Samsung.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"141\" data-total-count=\"9730\" id=\"story-continues-14\">But critics still saw a top-down approach. For example, the company announced Start-Up Samsung with a coordinated pledge from top executives.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"565\" data-total-count=\"10295\" id=\"story-continues-15\">Some current and former employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, said pressure from the top has only grown worse under Mr. Lee. Samsung\u2019s phone business \u2014 which was losing market share <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/technology/personaltech/with-galaxy-s6-and-s6-edge-samsung-tries-to-regain-its-footing.html\">in China and elsewhere</a> to cheap and increasingly sophisticated Chinese products made by Huawei and OnePlus \u2014 had made gains against Apple at the top end of the smartphone market. Hoping to capitalize, Samsung executives rushed to get its most powerful phone yet, the Galaxy Note 7, on the market before Apple introduced its new iPhone 7.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"468\" data-total-count=\"10763\">The result was disaster. First, a few Note 7 phones <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/samsung-galaxy-consumer-product-safety.html\">caught fire</a>. Then, after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/business/samsung-galaxy-note-battery.html\">an embarrassing and costly recall</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/business/samsung-galaxy-note-fires.html\">new versions caught on fire</a> too. In an unusual move in the gadget business, Samsung pulled the phone from the market and canceled it. Kim Sang-jo, the Hansung University economist, and other outside experts blamed Mr. Lee and the corporate strategy office for the Note 7 debacle, saying they pushed big goals without listening to lower-level managers.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"197\" data-total-count=\"10960\">At the same time, the corporate strategy office was coming under fire for another move, a deal that would strengthen the family\u2019s hold on Samsung \u2014 but one that would also engulf it in scandal.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"209\" data-total-count=\"11187\" id=\"story-continues-16\">Under that office, Samsung pushed a merger of two of its units, Cheil Industries and Samsung C&amp;T. Many outside shareholders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/business/dealbook/an-activist-investor-takes-aim-at-bid-for-samsung.html\">opposed the move</a>, which would cement Mr. Lee\u2019s control over the whole conglomerate.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"134\" data-total-count=\"11321\">The trick was getting government approval \u2014 and to win it, prosecutors say, Mr. Lee and the corporate strategy office broke the law.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"573\" data-total-count=\"11894\" id=\"story-continues-17\">According to prosecutors, Mr. Lee met with South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, three times in an effort to cement the deal and smooth Mr. Lee\u2019s rise to power. In return, they say, Ms. Park, who has been impeached, asked Mr. Lee to support two foundations controlled by her secret confidante, a woman named <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/world/asia/south-korea-choi-soon-sil.html\">Choi Soon-sil</a>. According to prosecutors, Mr. Lee and members of Samsung\u2019s corporate strategy office gave foundations and businesses linked to Ms. Choi $38 million. Samsung\u2019s contributions to Ms. Choi included an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/samsung-scion-to-be-indicted-on-bribery-charges/2017/02/28/b5988fca-863c-4ca7-8b7d-9e105549d9a9_story.html?utm_term=.7eb096d19257\">$900,000 horse</a> for her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/world/asia/south-korea-scandal-choi-soon-sil-daughter.html\">equestrian daughter</a>.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"302\" data-total-count=\"12196\">The country\u2019s national pension fund, a major shareholder of the two Samsung companies, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/asia/south-korea-samsung-merger-moon-hyung-pyo.html\">approved the deal</a>. According to prosecutors, the completed merger increased the stock value of the Lee family by at least $758 million. The country\u2019s national pension fund lost at least $123 million on the deal.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"252\" data-total-count=\"12448\" id=\"story-continues-18\">In a statement, Samsung said shareholders of both companies approved the deal before any donations were made. But it also said it introduced measures to manage donations, including greater public disclosure and more reviews by executives and directors.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"342\" data-total-count=\"12790\" id=\"story-continues-19\">Ms. Choi\u2019s relationship with Ms. Park last year ignited a nationwide scandal. Ms. Choi, who has no formal government title, was reported to have been involved with writing Ms. Park\u2019s speeches, choosing top government officials and even selecting her outfits. As the scandal spread, the alleged bribes came to the attention of prosecutors.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"332\" data-total-count=\"13122\">For many South Koreans, the scandal resonates. Ms. Park, who could soon be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-impeachment.html\">removed from office</a>, is the daughter of the dictator who gave Mr. Lee\u2019s family the support to broaden Samsung into the giant it is today. It also underscores the perception that today\u2019s chaebol leaders are hurting more than they are helping the country.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"171\" data-total-count=\"13293\">Others have said that the company culture has grown more strict since Mr. Lee\u2019s father was incapacitated and pressures on the company to perform well under Mr. Lee grew.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"211\" data-total-count=\"13504\" id=\"story-continues-20\">\u201cThey forgot their fathers\u2019 and grandfathers\u2019 entrepreneurship,\u201d said Mr. Moon, the opposition leader, referring to Mr. Lee and other third-generation chaebol leaders, \u201cand chose to make easy money.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"345\" data-total-count=\"13849\">Stung by the scandal, Samsung closed the corporate strategy office. Skeptics point out that Samsung has done that before. Mr. Lee\u2019s father disbanded the office when he ran into legal trouble, only to re-establish it under its current name once those troubles blew over. Its functions may simply migrate to another part of the empire, they say.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"168\" data-total-count=\"14017\">\u201cThe mission right now is to save Jay Y. Lee,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Saving Private Ryan.\u2019\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"116\" data-total-count=\"14133\">Samsung said in a statement that its companies would be managed independently by its chief executives and directors.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"60\" data-total-count=\"14193\" id=\"story-continues-21\">But there is reason to believe this time could be different.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"397\" data-total-count=\"14590\">Already Mr. Lee has been punished more than his father, who never spent any time in jail. The case also implicates South Korea\u2019s president, while approval ratings for her pro-business party have plummeted, meaning political protection from the top is less likely. And public anger about collusion between companies and the government has never been greater, with protests breaking out this year.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"448\" data-total-count=\"15038\" id=\"story-continues-22\">It isn\u2019t clear whether somebody else may emerge to lead Samsung. Lee Boo-jin, Mr. Lee\u2019s sister and the country\u2019s richest woman, runs the Samsung affiliate Hotel Shilla, which also operates duty-free shops. With her brother in jail, some analysts speculated that she might try to increase her profile within the vast corporate empire. But most analysts say Samsung\u2019s complicated hierarchy is already dominated by executives loyal to Mr. Lee.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"139\" data-total-count=\"15177\" id=\"story-continues-23\">While analysts warn it isn\u2019t likely anything will immediately change, Samsung is undoubtedly facing a new level of pressure and scrutiny.</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"392\" data-total-count=\"15569\">\u201cThe thing about Samsung is, it\u2019s a giant wound-up ball of yarn of cross-holdings,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book on Samsung. \u201cThe setup is so complicated that sometimes I wonder if a group of smart people could find a way to tug at the right connection and find a way to loosen it up, to unravel it a bit, just to see if they could pull it away from the company.\u201d</p> <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"56\" data-total-count=\"15625\">He added, \u201cThat\u2019s never happened in Korea before.\u201d</p>",

   "content": "SEOUL  Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee will go on trial for bribery and embezzlement on Thursday, a court said, amid a corruption scandal that has rocked South Korea and led to the impeachment of the president.  Lee, the 48-year-old third-generation leader of the country's top conglomerate, was indicted on Tuesday on charges including pledging 43 billion won ($37.24 million) in payments to a confidant of President Park Geun-hye. \"We are preparing hard, thinking that the upcoming Samsung trial ... could be the trial of the century that the entire world will be watching,\" special prosecutor Park Young-soo told reporters. The Samsung scion's hearing will be held in a court that can accommodate more than 150 people, according to the Seoul Central District Court's court database.  Lee, who was arrested on Feb. 17, was charged with bribery and embezzlement in a case that has dealt a blow to the standard bearer for Asia's fourth-largest economy.  \n Samsung Group declined to comment but has denied wrongdoing. Among the charges against Lee are pledging bribes to a company and organizations tied to Park's confidant, Choi Soon-sil, the woman at the center of the scandal, to cement his control of the smartphones-to-biopharmaceuticals business empire. The funding also included Samsung's sponsorship of the equestrian career of Choi's daughter, prosecutors say.  \n Legislation appointing the special prosecutor states that the trial should be finished in three months.  President Park, 65, daughter of a former military strongman, has had her powers suspended since her impeachment by parliament in December. \n Should the Constitutional Court uphold the impeachment, she would become the country's first democratically elected president to be thrown out of office. A decision is expected this month.  (Reporting by Ju-min Park, additional reporting by Se Young Lee, Editing by Nick Macfie)",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates, was indicted on charges of bribery and embezzlement on Tuesday, becoming one of the most prominent business tycoons to stand trial in South Korea.   Mr. Lee\u2019s indictment came at the end of a special prosecutor\u2019s 90-day investigation of a corruption scandal that had already led to the  impeachment of President Park Geun-hye . Mr. Lee was  arrested  on Feb. 17.   Mr. Lee was accused of giving or promising Choi Soon-sil, a secretive confidante of President Park, a total of $38 million in bribes, including thoroughbred horses for Ms. Choi\u2019s daughter, an equestrian.   In return, Mr. Lee received political favors, most notably government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped him inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, Lee Kun-hee, the Samsung chairman, the prosecutor said in his indictment.   Mr. Lee was also accused of committing perjury when he insisted during a parliamentary hearing that he never bribed Ms. Choi or Ms. Park. He still claims that the \u201cdonations\u201d Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, suggesting that the company was extorted.   Four other senior executives of Samsung were indicted \u2014 but were not arrested \u2014 on the same charges on Tuesday for their alleged involvement in the deal between their boss and Ms. Choi. Three of the four resigned on Tuesday.   Mr. Lee, 48, a vice chairman of Samsung, has been running the company since his father had a heart attack in 2014.   Samsung is by far the largest among the chaebol, or family-controlled conglomerates, that dominate the South Korean economy. For decades the company has symbolized both power and wealth in the country.   Its market capitalization accounts for one-fourth of the value of all listed companies in South Korea, and its main unit, Samsung Electronics, alone ships 20 percent of the country\u2019s total exports.",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean special prosecutors indicted Samsung's de facto chief Tuesday on bribery, embezzlement and other charges linked to a political scandal that has toppled President Park Geun-hye.   The indictment of Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong is a huge hit for the largest and most successful of the big businesses that dominate the South Korean economy. It also signals the still roiling state of South Korea's political and economic circles after weeks of massive demonstrations that led to Park's impeachment.   The announcement of the indictment came after a three-month investigation by a special prosecution team that ended Tuesday after the country's acting leader refused a request for an extension.   Shortly after the announcement, Samsung said several top executives also facing criminal charges will resign from their positions and leave Samsung.   It did not say anything about Lee's status, implying that the Samsung heir will likely keep his position and board membership at Samsung Electronics while he is under arrest and stands trial.   Prosecutors say Lee gave bribes worth $36 million to Park and her confidante to help win government support for a smooth leadership transfer from Lee's ailing father to Lee.   Lee also allegedly hid assets overseas, concealed proceeds from criminal activities and committed perjury. The 48-year-old billionaire was arrested Feb. 17. Samsung has denied wrongdoing.   Prosecutors also said they planned to indict four other Samsung executives on charges of offering bribes, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and concealing proceeds from criminal activities.   The indictments mean that key figures at a powerful yet secretive Samsung office that wielded influence over dozens of Samsung affiliates face trial. Lee promised in December to disband the secretive office, called the Corporate Strategy Office, which allegedly orchestrated bribery schemes centered on Choi Soon-sil, Park's confidante.   The office consists of close Lee family aides who worked to help ensure the father to son leadership transition. Some say the contentious merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in 2015 was also overseen by the office, not by the board of directors at the two Samsung companies. The merger, a crucial step for Lee to strengthen his grip on Samsung Electronics, was a key benefit that Samsung sought from the government by offering millions of dollars to Choi's various entities, according to the prosecutors.   The merger, despite opposition from some shareholders who argued that it unfairly benefited the Lee family, was approved by shareholders thanks to the support of a state-controlled national pension fund, a key Samsung investor.   The special prosecution team said it also plans to pursue additional charges of bribery and concealing proceedings from criminal activities against Choi, who allegedly exploited her presidential ties to extort money and favors from companies and manipulate state affairs from the shadows.   The team finished its inquiry without questioning Park, after she backed off from a Feb. 9 interview. The country's acting leader, Hwang Kyo-ahn, refused to extend the investigation past Tuesday's deadline.   Lee was once the face of the new Samsung, but now follows in the footsteps of his father, Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Kun-hee. The senior Lee was indicted in 2008 on charges of tax evasion and breach of trust. He was later convicted and then pardoned by a former president.   Corruption has dogged many other business leaders in South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates, which are known as chaebol.   When the elder Lee was indicted, Samsung vowed a series of measures to improve transparency.   After the prosecutors' announcement Tuesday, Samsung said it would disband the secretive office.   Since Lee's father fell ill in May 2014, the younger Lee has stepped up his leadership role. Samsung appeared to be trying to change its top-down, hierarchical, authoritarian corporate culture under Lee.   Fluent in foreign languages, educated overseas and linked to Silicon Valley luminaries, Lee was seen as the new face of Samsung. Samsung promised to remove obstacles to creativity and innovation in recent years by introducing a nimble, startup-like attitude. It has increased returns to shareholders and acquired several companies outside South Korea.   __   Follow Lee on Twitter at  twitter.com/YKLee   Follow Kim on Twitter at  twitter.com/KimTongHyung",

   "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  (AP) \u2014 South Korean special prosecutors said they would indict Samsung's de facto chief Tuesday on bribery, embezzlement and other charges linked to a political scandal that has toppled President Park Geun-hye.   The planned indictment of Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong is a huge hit for the largest and most successful of the big businesses that dominate the South Korean economy. It also signals the still roiling state of South Korea's political and economic circles after weeks of massive demonstrations that led to Park's impeachment.   The announcements of the planned indictment came after a three-month investigation by the special prosecution team, which ended Tuesday after the country's acting leader refused a request for an extension.   Shortly after the prosecutors' announcement, Samsung said that several top executives also facing criminal charges would resign from their positions and leave Samsung.   It did not say anything about Lee's position, implying that the Samsung heir will likely keep his position and board membership at Samsung Electronics while he is under arrest and stands trial.   Prosecutors say the Samsung heir gave bribes worth $36 million to Park and her confidante to help win government support for a smooth leadership transfer from Lee's ailing father to Lee.   Lee also allegedly hid assets overseas, concealed proceeds from criminal activities and committed perjury. The 48-year-old billionaire was arrested Feb. 17. Samsung has denied wrongdoing.   Prosecutors also said they planned to indict four other Samsung executives on charges of offering bribes, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and concealing proceeds from criminal activities.   The planned indictments mean that key figures at a powerful yet secretive Samsung office that wielded influence over dozens of Samsung affiliates face trial. Lee promised in December to disband the secretive office, called the Corporate Strategy Office, which allegedly orchestrated bribery schemes centered on Choi Soon-sil, Park's confidante.   The office consists of close Lee family aides who worked to help ensure the father to son leadership transition. Some say that the contentious merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in 2015 was also overseen by the office, not by the board of directors at the two Samsung companies. The merger, a crucial step for Lee to strengthen his grip on Samsung Electronics, was a key benefit that Samsung sought from the government by offering millions of dollars to Choi's various entities, according to the prosecutors.   The merger, despite opposition from some shareholders who argued that it unfairly benefited the Lee family, was approved by shareholders thanks to the support of a state-controlled national pension fund, a key Samsung investor.   The special prosecution team said it also plans to pursue additional charges of bribery and concealing proceedings from criminal activities against Choi, who allegedly exploited her presidential ties to extort money and favors from companies and manipulate state affairs from the shadows.   The team finished its inquiry without questioning Park, after she backed off from a Feb. 9 interview. The country's acting leader, Hwang Kyo-ahn, refused to extend the investigation past Tuesday's deadline.   Lee was once the face of the new Samsung, but now follows in the footsteps of his father, Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Kun-hee. The senior Lee was indicted in 2008 on charges of tax evasion and breach of trust. He was later convicted and then pardoned by a former president.   Corruption has dogged many other business leaders in South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates, which are known as chaebol.   When the elder Lee was indicted, Samsung vowed a series of measures to improve transparency.   After the prosecutors' announcement Tuesday, Samsung said it would disband the secretive office.   Since Lee's father fell ill in May 2014, the younger Lee has stepped up his leadership role. Samsung appeared to be trying to change its top-down, hierarchical, authoritarian corporate culture under Lee.   Fluent in foreign languages, educated overseas and linked to Silicon Valley luminaries, Lee was seen as the new face of Samsung. Samsung promised to remove obstacles to creativity and innovation in recent years by introducing a nimble, startup-like attitude. It has increased returns to shareholders and acquired several companies outside South Korea.   __   Follow Lee:  www.twitter.com/YKLee   Follow Kim:  www.twitter.com/KimTongHyung",

It also signals the still roiling state of South Korea's political and economic circles after weeks of massive demonstrations that led to Park's impeachment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The announcements of the planned indictment came after a three-month investigation by the special prosecution team, which ended Tuesday after the country's acting leader refused a request for an extension.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Shortly after the prosecutors' announcement, Samsung said that several top executives also facing criminal charges would resign from their positions and leave Samsung.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">It did not say anything about Lee's position, implying that the Samsung heir will likely keep his position and board membership at Samsung Electronics while he is under arrest and stands trial.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors say the Samsung heir gave bribes worth $36 million to Park and her confidante to help win government support for a smooth leadership transfer from Lee's ailing father to Lee.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee also allegedly hid assets overseas, concealed proceeds from criminal activities and committed perjury. The 48-year-old billionaire was arrested Feb. 17. Samsung has denied wrongdoing.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors also said they planned to indict four other Samsung executives on charges of offering bribes, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and concealing proceeds from criminal activities.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The planned indictments mean that key figures at a powerful yet secretive Samsung office that wielded influence over dozens of Samsung affiliates face trial. Lee promised in December to disband the secretive office, called the Corporate Strategy Office, which allegedly orchestrated bribery schemes centered on Choi Soon-sil, Park's confidante.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The office consists of close Lee family aides who worked to help ensure the father to son leadership transition. Some say that the contentious merger of Samsung C&amp;T and Cheil Industries in 2015 was also overseen by the office, not by the board of directors at the two Samsung companies. The merger, a crucial step for Lee to strengthen his grip on Samsung Electronics, was a key benefit that Samsung sought from the government by offering millions of dollars to Choi's various entities, according to the prosecutors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The merger, despite opposition from some shareholders who argued that it unfairly benefited the Lee family, was approved by shareholders thanks to the support of a state-controlled national pension fund, a key Samsung investor.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The special prosecution team said it also plans to pursue additional charges of bribery and concealing proceedings from criminal activities against Choi, who allegedly exploited her presidential ties to extort money and favors from companies and manipulate state affairs from the shadows.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The team finished its inquiry without questioning Park, after she backed off from a Feb. 9 interview.

Lee promised in December to disband the secretive office, called the Corporate Strategy Office, which allegedly orchestrated bribery schemes centered on Choi Soon-sil, Park's confidante.   Shortly after the prosecutors' announcement, Samsung announced a series of measures to improve its transparency, including disbanding the secretive office and resignations from top executives who prosecutors said they would indict. Lee wasn't included in the resignations, implying he will keep his position and board membership at Samsung Electronics during court proceedings.   The office consists of close Lee family aides who worked to help ensure the father to son leadership transition.

Corruption has dogged many other business leaders in South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates, which are known as chaebol.   When the elder Lee was indicted, Samsung vowed a series of measures to improve transparency. It is expected to announce more measures following the younger Lee's indictment.   Since Lee's father fell ill in May 2014, the younger Lee has stepped up his leadership role.

   "raw_content": "<p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean special prosecutors said they would indict Samsung's de facto chief Tuesday on bribery, embezzlement and other charges linked to a political scandal that has toppled President Park Geun-hye.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The planned indictment of Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong is a huge hit for the largest and most successful of the big businesses that dominate the South Korean economy. It also signals the still roiling state of South Korea's political and economic circles after weeks of massive demonstrations that led to Park's impeachment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The announcements of the planned indictments came after a three-month investigation by the special prosecution team, which ended Tuesday after the country's acting leader refused a request for an extension.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors say the Samsung heir gave bribes worth $36 million to Park and her confidante to help win government support for a smooth leadership transfer from Lee's ailing father to Lee.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee also allegedly hid assets overseas, concealed proceeds from criminal activities and committed perjury. The 48-year-old billionaire was arrested Feb. 17. Samsung has denied wrongdoing.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Prosecutors also said they planned to indict four other Samsung executives on charges of offering bribes, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and concealing proceeds from criminal activities.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The planned indictments mean that key figures at a powerful yet secretive Samsung office that wielded influence over dozens of Samsung affiliates face trial. Lee promised in December to disband the secretive office, called the Corporate Strategy Office, which allegedly orchestrated bribery schemes centered on Choi Soon-sil, Park's confidante.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Shortly after the prosecutors' announcement, Samsung announced a series of measures to improve its transparency, including disbanding the secretive office and resignations from top executives who prosecutors said they would indict. Lee wasn't included in the resignations, implying he will keep his position and board membership at Samsung Electronics during court proceedings.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The office consists of close Lee family aides who worked to help ensure the father to son leadership transition. Some say that the contentious merger of Samsung C&amp;T and Cheil Industries in 2015 was also overseen by the office, not by the board of directors at the two Samsung companies. The merger, a crucial step for Lee to strengthen his grip on Samsung Electronics, was a key benefit that Samsung sought from the government by offering millions of dollars to Choi's various entities, according to the prosecutors.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The merger, despite opposition from some shareholders who argued that it unfairly benefited the Lee family, was approved by shareholders thanks to the support of a state-controlled national pension fund, a key Samsung investor.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The special prosecution team said they also plan to pursue additional charges of bribery and concealing proceedings from criminal activities against Choi, who allegedly exploited her presidential ties to extort money and favors from companies and manipulate state affairs from the shadows.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">The special prosecution team finished its inquiry without questioning Park, after she backed off from a Feb. 9 interview. The country's acting leader, Hwang Kyo-ahn, refused to extend the investigation past Tuesday's deadline.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Lee was once the face of the new Samsung, but now follows in the footsteps of his father, Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Kun-hee. The senior Lee was indicted in 2008 on charges of tax evasion and a breach of trust. He was later convicted and then pardoned by a former president.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Corruption has dogged many other business leaders in South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates, which are known as chaebol.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">When the elder Lee was indicted, Samsung vowed a series of measures to improve transparency. It is expected to announce more measures following the younger Lee's indictment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Since Lee's father fell ill in May 2014, the younger Lee has stepped up his leadership role. Samsung appeared to be trying to change its top-down, hierarchical, authoritarian corporate culture under Lee.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px\" class=\"ap_para ap_para-d57851005a80479aaeeb90a12c70b9f6 entry-content\">Fluent in foreign languages, educated overseas and linked to Silicon Valley luminaries, Lee was seen as the new face of Samsung. Samsung promised to remove obstacles to creativity and innovation in recent years by introducing a nimble, startup-like attitude. It has increased returns to shareholders and acquired several companies outside South Korea.</p>",
